<h3>I.</h3>

    <p>
      <span class="smcap">It</span> rose for them&mdash;their honey-moon&mdash;over the waters of a lake so
      famed as the scene of romantic raptures that they were rather proud of not
      having been afraid to choose it as the setting of their own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It required a total lack of humour, or as great a gift for it as ours, to
      risk the experiment,&rdquo; Susy Lansing opined, as they hung over the
      inevitable marble balustrade and watched their tutelary orb roll its magic
      carpet across the waters to their feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;or the loan of Strefford&rsquo;s villa,&rdquo; her husband emended,
      glancing upward through the branches at a long low patch of paleness to
      which the moonlight was beginning to give the form of a white house-front.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come when we&rsquo;d five to choose from. At least if you count the Chicago
      flat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So we had&mdash;you wonder!&rdquo; He laid his hand on hers, and his touch
      renewed the sense of marvelling exultation which the deliberate survey of
      their adventure always roused in her.... It was characteristic that she
      merely added, in her steady laughing tone: &ldquo;Or, not counting the flat&mdash;for
      I hate to brag&mdash;just consider the others: Violet Melrose&rsquo;s place at
      Versailles, your aunt&rsquo;s villa at Monte Carlo&mdash;and a moor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was conscious of throwing in the moor tentatively, and yet with a
      somewhat exaggerated emphasis, as if to make sure that he shouldn&rsquo;t accuse
      her of slurring it over. But he seemed to have no desire to do so. &ldquo;Poor
      old Fred!&rdquo; he merely remarked; and she breathed out carelessly: &ldquo;Oh, well&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His hand still lay on hers, and for a long interval, while they stood
      silent in the enveloping loveliness of the night, she was aware only of
      the warm current running from palm to palm, as the moonlight below them
      drew its line of magic from shore to shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nick Lansing spoke at last. &ldquo;Versailles in May would have been impossible:
      all our Paris crowd would have run us down within twenty-four hours. And
      Monte Carlo is ruled out because it&rsquo;s exactly the kind of place everybody
      expected us to go. So&mdash;with all respect to you&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t much
      of a mental strain to decide on Como.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His wife instantly challenged this belittling of her capacity. &ldquo;It took a
      good deal of argument to convince you that we could face the ridicule of
      Como!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I should have preferred something in a lower key; at least I
      thought I should till we got here. Now I see that this place is idiotic
      unless one is perfectly happy; and that then it&rsquo;s&mdash;as good as any other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sighed out a blissful assent. &ldquo;And I must say that Streffy has done
      things to a turn. Even the cigars&mdash;who do you suppose gave him those
      cigars?&rdquo; She added thoughtfully: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll miss them when we have to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I say, don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s talk to-night about going. Aren&rsquo;t we outside of
      time and space...? Smell that guinea-a-bottle stuff over there: what is
      it? Stephanotis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Y&mdash;yes.... I suppose so. Or gardenias.... Oh, the fire-flies! Look...
      there, against that splash of moonlight on the water. Apples of silver in
      a net-work of gold....&rdquo; They leaned together, one flesh from shoulder to
      finger-tips, their eyes held by the snared glitter of the ripples.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could bear,&rdquo; Lansing remarked, &ldquo;even a nightingale at this moment....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A faint gurgle shook the magnolias behind them, and a long liquid whisper
      answered it from the thicket of laurel above their heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little late in the year for them: they&rsquo;re ending just as we
      begin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susy laughed. &ldquo;I hope when our turn comes we shall say good-bye to each
      other as sweetly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was in her husband&rsquo;s mind to answer: &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not saying good-bye, but
      only settling down to family cares.&rdquo; But as this did not happen to be in
      his plan, or in Susy&rsquo;s, he merely echoed her laugh and pressed her closer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spring night drew them into its deepening embrace. The ripples of the
      lake had gradually widened and faded into a silken smoothness, and high
      above the mountains the moon was turning from gold to white in a sky
      powdered with vanishing stars. Across the lake the lights of a little town
      went out, one after another, and the distant shore became a floating
      blackness. A breeze that rose and sank brushed their faces with the scents
      of the garden; once it blew out over the water a great white moth like a
      drifting magnolia petal. The nightingales had paused and the trickle of
      the fountain behind the house grew suddenly insistent.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Susy spoke it was in a voice languid with visions. &ldquo;I have been
      thinking,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that we ought to be able to make it last at least a
      year longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her husband received the remark without any sign of surprise or
      disapprobation; his answer showed that he not only understood her, but had
      been inwardly following the same train of thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; he enquired after a pause, &ldquo;without counting your
      grandmother&rsquo;s pearls?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;without the pearls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pondered a while, and then rejoined in a tender whisper: &ldquo;Tell me again
      just how.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s sit down, then. No, I like the cushions best.&rdquo; He stretched himself
      in a long willow chair, and she curled up on a heap of boat-cushions and
      leaned her head against his knee. Just above her, when she lifted her
      lids, she saw bits of moon-flooded sky incrusted like silver in a sharp
      black patterning of plane-boughs. All about them breathed of peace and
      beauty and stability, and her happiness was so acute that it was almost a
      relief to remember the stormy background of bills and borrowing against
      which its frail structure had been reared. &ldquo;People with a balance can&rsquo;t be
      as happy as all this,&rdquo; Susy mused, letting the moonlight filter through
      her lazy lashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      People with a balance had always been Susy Branch&rsquo;s bugbear; they were
      still, and more dangerously, to be Susy Lansing&rsquo;s. She detested them,
      detested them doubly, as the natural enemies of mankind and as the people
      one always had to put one&rsquo;s self out for. The greater part of her life
      having been passed among them, she knew nearly all that there was to know
      about them, and judged them with the contemptuous lucidity of nearly
      twenty years of dependence. But at the present moment her animosity was
      diminished not only by the softening effect of love but by the fact that
      she had got out of those very people more&mdash;yes, ever so much more&mdash;than
      she and Nick, in their hours of most reckless planning, had ever dared to
      hope for.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all, we owe them this!&rdquo; she mused.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband, lost in the drowsy beatitude of the hour, had not repeated
      his question; but she was still on the trail of the thought he had
      started. A year&mdash;yes, she was sure now that with a little management
      they could have a whole year of it! &ldquo;It&rdquo; was their marriage, their being
      together, and away from bores and bothers, in a comradeship of which both
      of them had long ago guessed the immediate pleasure, but she at least had
      never imagined the deeper harmony.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at one of their earliest meetings&mdash;at one of the heterogeneous
      dinners that the Fred Gillows tried to think &ldquo;literary&rdquo;&mdash;that the
      young man who chanced to sit next to her, and of whom it was vaguely
      rumoured that he had &ldquo;written,&rdquo; had presented himself to her imagination
      as the sort of luxury to which Susy Branch, heiress, might conceivably
      have treated herself as a crowning folly. Susy Branch, pauper, was fond of
      picturing how this fancied double would employ her millions: it was one of
      her chief grievances against her rich friends that they disposed of theirs
      so unimaginatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather have a husband like that than a steam-yacht!&rdquo; she had thought
      at the end of her talk with the young man who had written, and as to whom
      it had at once been clear to her that nothing his pen had produced, or
      might hereafter set down, would put him in a position to offer his wife
      anything more costly than a row-boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His wife! As if he could ever have one! For he&rsquo;s not the kind to marry
      for a yacht either.&rdquo; In spite of her past, Susy had preserved enough inner
      independence to detect the latent signs of it in others, and also to
      ascribe it impulsively to those of the opposite sex who happened to
      interest her. She had a natural contempt for people who gloried in what
      they need only have endured. She herself meant eventually to marry,
      because one couldn&rsquo;t forever hang on to rich people; but she was going to
      wait till she found some one who combined the maximum of wealth with at
      least a minimum of companionableness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had at once perceived young Lansing&rsquo;s case to be exactly the opposite:
      he was as poor as he could be, and as companionable as it was possible to
      imagine. She therefore decided to see as much of him as her hurried and
      entangled life permitted; and this, thanks to a series of adroit
      adjustments, turned out to be a good deal. They met frequently all the
      rest of that winter; so frequently that Mrs. Fred Gillow one day abruptly
      and sharply gave Susy to understand that she was &ldquo;making herself
      ridiculous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah&mdash;&rdquo; said Susy with a long breath, looking her friend and patroness
      straight in the painted eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried Ursula Gillow in a sob, &ldquo;before you interfered Nick liked me
      awfully... and, of course, I don&rsquo;t want to reproach you... but when I
      think....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susy made no answer. How could she, when she thought? The dress she had on
      had been given her by Ursula; Ursula&rsquo;s motor had carried her to the feast
      from which they were both returning. She counted on spending the following
      August with the Gillows at Newport... and the only alternative was to go
      to California with the Bockheimers, whom she had hitherto refused even to
      dine with.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, what you fancy is perfect nonsense, Ursula; and as to my
      interfering&mdash;&rdquo; Susy hesitated, and then murmured: &ldquo;But if it will
      make you any happier I&rsquo;ll arrange to see him less often....&rdquo; She sounded
      the lowest depths of subservience in returning Ursula&rsquo;s tearful kiss....
    </p>
    <p>
      Susy Branch had a masculine respect for her word; and the next day she put
      on her most becoming hat and sought out young Mr. Lansing in his lodgings.
      She was determined to keep her promise to Ursula; but she meant to look
      her best when she did it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew at what time the young man was likely to be found, for he was
      doing a dreary job on a popular encyclopaedia (V to X), and had told her
      what hours were dedicated to the hateful task. &ldquo;Oh, if only it were a
      novel!&rdquo; she thought as she mounted his dingy stairs; but immediately
      reflected that, if it were the kind that she could bear to read, it
      probably wouldn&rsquo;t bring him in much more than his encyclopaedia. Miss
      Branch had her standards in literature....
    </p>
    <p>
      The apartment to which Mr. Lansing admitted her was a good deal cleaner,
      but hardly less dingy, than his staircase. Susy, knowing him to be
      addicted to Oriental archaeology, had pictured him in a bare room adorned
      by a single Chinese bronze of flawless shape, or by some precious fragment
      of Asiatic pottery. But such redeeming features were conspicuously absent,
      and no attempt had been made to disguise the decent indigence of the
      bed-sitting-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lansing welcomed his visitor with every sign of pleasure, and with
      apparent indifference as to what she thought of his furniture. He seemed
      to be conscious only of his luck in seeing her on a day when they had not
      expected to meet. This made Susy all the sorrier to execute her promise,
      and the gladder that she had put on her prettiest hat; and for a moment or
      two she looked at him in silence from under its conniving brim.
    </p>
    <p>
      Warm as their mutual liking was, Lansing had never said a word of love to
      her; but this was no deterrent to his visitor, whose habit it was to speak
      her meaning clearly when there were no reasons, worldly or pecuniary, for
      its concealment. After a moment, therefore, she told him why she had come;
      it was a nuisance, of course, but he would understand. Ursula Gillow was
      jealous, and they would have to give up seeing each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man&rsquo;s burst of laughter was music to her; for, after all, she
      had been rather afraid that being devoted to Ursula might be as much in
      his day&rsquo;s work as doing the encyclopaedia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I give you my word it&rsquo;s a raving-mad mistake! And I don&rsquo;t believe she
      ever meant me, to begin with&mdash;&rdquo; he protested; but Susy, her
      common-sense returning with her reassurance, promptly cut short his
      denial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can trust Ursula to make herself clear on such occasions. And it
      doesn&rsquo;t make any difference what you think. All that matters is what she
      believes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come! I&rsquo;ve got a word to say about that too, haven&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susy looked slowly and consideringly about the room. There was nothing in
      it, absolutely nothing, to show that he had ever possessed a spare dollar&mdash;or
      accepted a present.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not as far as I&rsquo;m concerned,&rdquo; she finally pronounced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean? If I&rsquo;m as free as air&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He grew thoughtful. &ldquo;Oh, then, of course&mdash;. It only seems a little
      odd,&rdquo; he added drily, &ldquo;that in that case, the protest should have come
      from Mrs. Gillow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Instead of coming from my millionaire bridegroom, Oh, I haven&rsquo;t any; in
      that respect I&rsquo;m as free as you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then&mdash;? Haven&rsquo;t we only got to stay free?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susy drew her brows together anxiously. It was going to be rather more
      difficult than she had supposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said I was as free in that respect. I&rsquo;m not going to marry&mdash;and I
      don&rsquo;t suppose you are?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God, no!&rdquo; he ejaculated fervently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that doesn&rsquo;t always imply complete freedom....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood just above her, leaning his elbow against the hideous black
      marble arch that framed his fireless grate. As she glanced up she saw his
      face harden, and the colour flew to hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was that what you came to tell me?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you don&rsquo;t understand&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t see why you don&rsquo;t, since we&rsquo;ve
      knocked about so long among exactly the same kind of people.&rdquo; She stood up
      impulsively and laid her hand on his arm. &ldquo;I do wish you&rsquo;d help me&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He remained motionless, letting the hand lie untouched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help you to tell me that poor Ursula was a pretext, but that there IS
      someone who&mdash;for one reason or another&mdash;really has a right to
      object to your seeing me too often?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susy laughed impatiently. &ldquo;You talk like the hero of a novel&mdash;the
      kind my governess used to read. In the first place I should never
      recognize that kind of right, as you call it&mdash;never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what kind do you?&rdquo; he asked with a clearing brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;the kind I suppose you recognize on the part of your
      publisher.&rdquo; This evoked a hollow laugh from him. &ldquo;A business claim, call
      it,&rdquo; she pursued. &ldquo;Ursula does a lot for me: I live on her for half the
      year. This dress I&rsquo;ve got on now is one she gave me. Her motor is going to
      take me to a dinner to-night. I&rsquo;m going to spend next summer with her at
      Newport.... If I don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ve got to go to California with the
      Bockheimers&mdash;so good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly in tears, she was out of the door and down his steep three
      flights before he could stop her&mdash;though, in thinking it over, she
      didn&rsquo;t even remember if he had tried to. She only recalled having stood a
      long time on the corner of Fifth Avenue, in the harsh winter radiance,
      waiting till a break in the torrent of motors laden with fashionable women
      should let her cross, and saying to herself: &ldquo;After all, I might have
      promised Ursula... and kept on seeing him....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Instead of which, when Lansing wrote the next day entreating a word with
      her, she had sent back a friendly but firm refusal; and had managed soon
      afterward to get taken to Canada for a fortnight&rsquo;s ski-ing, and then to
      Florida for six weeks in a house-boat....
    </p>
    <p>
      As she reached this point in her retrospect the remembrance of Florida
      called up a vision of moonlit waters, magnolia fragrance and balmy airs;
      merging with the circumambient sweetness, it laid a drowsy spell upon her
      lids. Yes, there had been a bad moment: but it was over; and she was here,
      safe and blissful, and with Nick; and this was his knee her head rested
      on, and they had a year ahead of them... a whole year.... &ldquo;Not counting
      the pearls,&rdquo; she murmured, shutting her eyes....
    </p>


    <h3>II.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Lansing</span> threw the end of Strefford&rsquo;s expensive cigar into the lake, and
      bent over his wife. Poor child! She had fallen asleep.... He leaned back
      and stared up again at the silver-flooded sky. How queer&mdash;how
      inexpressibly queer&mdash;it was to think that that light was shed by his
      honey-moon! A year ago, if anyone had predicted his risking such an
      adventure, he would have replied by asking to be locked up at the first
      symptoms....
    </p>
    <p>
      There was still no doubt in his mind that the adventure was a mad one. It
      was all very well for Susy to remind him twenty times a day that they had
      pulled it off&mdash;and so why should he worry? Even in the light of her
      far-seeing cleverness, and of his own present bliss, he knew the future
      would not bear the examination of sober thought. And as he sat there in
      the summer moonlight, with her head on his knee, he tried to recapitulate
      the successive steps that had landed them on Streffy&rsquo;s lake-front.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Lansing&rsquo;s side, no doubt, it dated back to his leaving Harvard with the
      large resolve not to miss anything. There stood the evergreen Tree of
      Life, the Four Rivers flowing from its foot; and on every one of the four
      currents he meant to launch his little skiff. On two of them he had not
      gone very far, on the third he had nearly stuck in the mud; but the fourth
      had carried him to the very heart of wonder. It was the stream of his
      lively imagination, of his inexhaustible interest in every form of beauty
      and strangeness and folly. On this stream, sitting in the stout little
      craft of his poverty, his insignificance and his independence, he had made
      some notable voyages.... And so, when Susy Branch, whom he had sought out
      through a New York season as the prettiest and most amusing girl in sight,
      had surprised him with the contradictory revelation of her modern sense of
      expediency and her old-fashioned standard of good faith, he had felt an
      irresistible desire to put off on one more cruise into the unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was of the essence of the adventure that, after her one brief visit to
      his lodgings, he should have kept his promise and not tried to see her
      again. Even if her straightforwardness had not roused his emulation, his
      understanding of her difficulties would have moved his pity. He knew on
      how frail a thread the popularity of the penniless hangs, and how
      miserably a girl like Susy was the sport of other people&rsquo;s moods and
      whims. It was a part of his difficulty and of hers that to get what they
      liked they so often had to do what they disliked. But the keeping of his
      promise was a greater bore than he had expected. Susy Branch had become a
      delightful habit in a life where most of the fixed things were dull, and
      her disappearance had made it suddenly clear to him that his resources
      were growing more and more limited. Much that had once amused him hugely
      now amused him less, or not at all: a good part of his world of wonder had
      shrunk to a village peep-show. And the things which had kept their
      stimulating power&mdash;distant journeys, the enjoyment of art, the
      contact with new scenes and strange societies&mdash;were becoming less and
      less attainable. Lansing had never had more than a pittance; he had spent
      rather too much of it in his first plunge into life, and the best he could
      look forward to was a middle-age of poorly-paid hack-work, mitigated by
      brief and frugal holidays. He knew that he was more intelligent than the
      average, but he had long since concluded that his talents were not
      marketable. Of the thin volume of sonnets which a friendly publisher had
      launched for him, just seventy copies had been sold; and though his essay
      on &ldquo;Chinese Influences in Greek Art&rdquo; had created a passing stir, it had
      resulted in controversial correspondence and dinner invitations rather
      than in more substantial benefits. There seemed, in short, no prospect of
      his ever earning money, and his restricted future made him attach an
      increasing value to the kind of friendship that Susy Branch had given him.
      Apart from the pleasure of looking at her and listening to her&mdash;of
      enjoying in her what others less discriminatingly but as liberally
      appreciated&mdash;he had the sense, between himself and her, of a kind of
      free-masonry of precocious tolerance and irony. They had both, in early
      youth, taken the measure of the world they happened to live in: they knew
      just what it was worth to them and for what reasons, and the community of
      these reasons lent to their intimacy its last exquisite touch. And now,
      because of some jealous whim of a dissatisfied fool of a woman, as to whom
      he felt himself no more to blame than any young man who has paid for good
      dinners by good manners, he was to be deprived of the one complete
      companionship he had ever known....
    </p>
    <p>
      His thoughts travelled on. He recalled the long dull spring in New York
      after his break with Susy, the weary grind on his last articles, his
      listless speculations as to the cheapest and least boring way of disposing
      of the summer; and then the amazing luck of going, reluctantly and at the
      last minute, to spend a Sunday with the poor Nat Fulmers, in the wilds of
      New Hampshire, and of finding Susy there&mdash;Susy, whom he had never
      even suspected of knowing anybody in the Fulmers&rsquo; set!
    </p>
    <p>
      She had behaved perfectly&mdash;and so had he&mdash;but they were
      obviously much too glad to see each other. And then it was unsettling to
      be with her in such a house as the Fulmers&rsquo;, away from the large setting
      of luxury they were both used to, in the cramped cottage where their host
      had his studio in the verandah, their hostess practiced her violin in the
      dining-room, and five ubiquitous children sprawled and shouted and blew
      trumpets and put tadpoles in the water-jugs, and the mid-day dinner was
      two hours late&mdash;and proportionately bad&mdash;because the Italian cook was
      posing for Fulmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lansing&rsquo;s first thought had been that meeting Susy in such circumstances
      would be the quickest way to cure them both of their regrets. The case of
      the Fulmers was an awful object-lesson in what happened to young people
      who lost their heads; poor Nat, whose pictures nobody bought, had gone to
      seed so terribly&mdash;and Grace, at twenty-nine, would never again be anything
      but the woman of whom people say, &ldquo;I can remember her when she was
      lovely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the devil of it was that Nat had never been such good company, or
      Grace so free from care and so full of music; and that, in spite of their
      disorder and dishevelment, and the bad food and general crazy discomfort,
      there was more amusement to be got out of their society than out of the
      most opulently staged house-party through which Susy and Lansing had ever
      yawned their way.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was almost a relief to the young man when, on the second afternoon,
      Miss Branch drew him into the narrow hall to say: &ldquo;I really can&rsquo;t stand
      the combination of Grace&rsquo;s violin and little Nat&rsquo;s motor-horn any longer.
      Do let us slip out till the duet is over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do they stand it, I wonder?&rdquo; he basely echoed, as he followed her up
      the wooded path behind the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might be worth finding out,&rdquo; she rejoined with a musing smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he remained resolutely skeptical. &ldquo;Oh, give them a year or two more
      and they&rsquo;ll collapse&mdash;! His pictures will never sell, you know. He&rsquo;ll
      never even get them into a show.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose not. And she&rsquo;ll never have time to do anything worth while with
      her music.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had reached a piny knoll high above the ledge on which the house was
      perched. All about them stretched an empty landscape of endless
      featureless wooded hills. &ldquo;Think of sticking here all the year round!&rdquo;
       Lansing groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. But then think of wandering over the world with some people!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Lord, yes. For instance, my trip to India with the Mortimer Hickses.
      But it was my only chance and what the deuce is one to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I knew!&rdquo; she sighed, thinking of the Bockheimers; and he turned
      and looked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knew what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The answer to your question. What is one to do&mdash;when one sees both
      sides of the problem? Or every possible side of it, indeed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had seated themselves on a commanding rock under the pines, but
      Lansing could not see the view at their feet for the stir of the brown
      lashes on her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean: Nat and Grace may after all be having the best of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I say, when I&rsquo;ve told you I see all the sides? Of course,&rdquo; Susy
      added hastily, &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t live as they do for a week. But it&rsquo;s wonderful
      how little it&rsquo;s dimmed them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly Nat was never more coruscating. And she keeps it up even
      better.&rdquo; He reflected. &ldquo;We do them good, I daresay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;or they us. I wonder which?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After that, he seemed to remember that they sat a long time silent, and
      that his next utterance was a boyish outburst against the tyranny of the
      existing order of things, abruptly followed by the passionate query why,
      since he and she couldn&rsquo;t alter it, and since they both had the habit of
      looking at facts as they were, they wouldn&rsquo;t be utter fools not to take
      their chance of being happy in the only way that was open to them, To this
      challenge he did not recall Susy&rsquo;s making any definite answer; but after
      another interval, in which all the world seemed framed in a sudden kiss,
      he heard her murmur to herself in a brooding tone: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose it&rsquo;s
      ever been tried before; but we might&mdash;.&rdquo; And then and there she had
      laid before him the very experiment they had since hazarded.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would have none of surreptitious bliss, she began by declaring; and
      she set forth her reasons with her usual lucid impartiality. In the first
      place, she should have to marry some day, and when she made the bargain
      she meant it to be an honest one; and secondly, in the matter of love, she
      would never give herself to anyone she did not really care for, and if
      such happiness ever came to her she did not want it shorn of half its
      brightness by the need of fibbing and plotting and dodging.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen too much of that kind of thing. Half the women I know who&rsquo;ve
      had lovers have had them for the fun of sneaking and lying about it; but
      the other half have been miserable. And I should be miserable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was at this point that she unfolded her plan. Why shouldn&rsquo;t they marry;
      belong to each other openly and honourably, if for ever so short a time,
      and with the definite understanding that whenever either of them got the
      chance to do better he or she should be immediately released? The law of
      their country facilitated such exchanges, and society was beginning to
      view them as indulgently as the law. As Susy talked, she warmed to her
      theme and began to develop its endless possibilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We should really, in a way, help more than we should hamper each other,&rdquo;
       she ardently explained. &ldquo;We both know the ropes so well; what one of us
      didn&rsquo;t see the other might&mdash;in the way of opportunities, I mean. And
      then we should be a novelty as married people. We&rsquo;re both rather unusually
      popular&mdash;why not be frank!&mdash;and it&rsquo;s such a blessing for
      dinner-givers to be able to count on a couple of whom neither one is a
      blank. Yes, I really believe we should be more than twice the success we
      are now; at least,&rdquo; she added with a smile, &ldquo;if there&rsquo;s that amount of
      room for improvement. I don&rsquo;t know how you feel; a man&rsquo;s popularity is so
      much less precarious than a girl&rsquo;s&mdash;but I know it would furbish me up
      tremendously to reappear as a married woman.&rdquo; She glanced away from him
      down the long valley at their feet, and added in a lower tone: &ldquo;And I
      should like, just for a little while, to feel I had something in life of
      my very own&mdash;something that nobody had lent me, like a fancy-dress or
      a motor or an opera cloak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The suggestion, at first, had seemed to Lansing as mad as it was
      enchanting: it had thoroughly frightened him. But Susy&rsquo;s arguments were
      irrefutable, her ingenuities inexhaustible. Had he ever thought it all
      out? She asked. No. Well, she had; and would he kindly not interrupt? In
      the first place, there would be all the wedding-presents. Jewels, and a
      motor, and a silver dinner service, did she mean? Not a bit of it! She
      could see he&rsquo;d never given the question proper thought. Cheques, my dear,
      nothing but cheques&mdash;she undertook to manage that on her side: she
      really thought she could count on about fifty, and she supposed he could
      rake up a few more? Well, all that would simply represent pocket-money!
      For they would have plenty of houses to live in: he&rsquo;d see. People were
      always glad to lend their house to a newly-married couple. It was such fun
      to pop down and see them: it made one feel romantic and jolly. All they
      need do was to accept the houses in turn: go on honey-mooning for a year!
      What was he afraid of? Didn&rsquo;t he think they&rsquo;d be happy enough to want to
      keep it up? And why not at least try&mdash;get engaged, and then see what
      would happen? Even if she was all wrong, and her plan failed, wouldn&rsquo;t it
      have been rather nice, just for a month or two, to fancy they were going
      to be happy? &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve often fancied it all by myself,&rdquo; she concluded; &ldquo;but
      fancying it with you would somehow be so awfully different....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was how it began: and this lakeside dream was what it had led up to.
      Fantastically improbable as they had seemed, all her previsions had come
      true. If there were certain links in the chain that Lansing had never been
      able to put his hand on, certain arrangements and contrivances that still
      needed further elucidation, why, he was lazily resolved to clear them up
      with her some day; and meanwhile it was worth all the past might have
      cost, and every penalty the future might exact of him, just to be sitting
      here in the silence and sweetness, her sleeping head on his knee, clasped
      in his joy as the hushed world was clasped in moonlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stooped down and kissed her. &ldquo;Wake up,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s bed-time.&rdquo;
     </p>


<h3>III.</h3>

    <p>
      <span class="smcap">Their</span> month of Como was within a few hours of ending. Till the last moment
      they had hoped for a reprieve; but the accommodating Streffy had been
      unable to put the villa at their disposal for a longer time, since he had
      had the luck to let it for a thumping price to some beastly bouncers who
      insisted on taking possession at the date agreed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lansing, leaving Susy&rsquo;s side at dawn, had gone down to the lake for a last
      plunge; and swimming homeward through the crystal light he looked up at
      the garden brimming with flowers, the long low house with the cypress wood
      above it, and the window behind which his wife still slept. The month had
      been exquisite, and their happiness as rare, as fantastically complete, as
      the scene before him. He sank his chin into the sunlit ripples and sighed
      for sheer content....
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a bore to be leaving the scene of such complete well-being, but the
      next stage in their progress promised to be hardly less delightful. Susy
      was a magician: everything she predicted came true. Houses were being
      showered on them; on all sides he seemed to see beneficent spirits winging
      toward them, laden with everything from a piano nobile in Venice to a camp
      in the Adirondacks. For the present, they had decided on the former. Other
      considerations apart, they dared not risk the expense of a journey across
      the Atlantic; so they were heading instead for the Nelson Vanderlyns&rsquo;
      palace on the Giudecca. They were agreed that, for reasons of expediency,
      it might be wise to return to New York for the coming winter. It would
      keep them in view, and probably lead to fresh opportunities; indeed, Susy
      already had in mind the convenient flat that she was sure a migratory
      cousin (if tactfully handled, and assured that they would not overwork her
      cook) could certainly be induced to lend them. Meanwhile the need of
      making plans was still remote; and if there was one art in which young
      Lansing&rsquo;s twenty-eight years of existence had perfected him it was that of
      living completely and unconcernedly in the present....
    </p>
    <p>
      If of late he had tried to look into the future more insistently than was
      his habit, it was only because of Susy. He had meant, when they married,
      to be as philosophic for her as for himself; and he knew she would have
      resented above everything his regarding their partnership as a reason for
      anxious thought. But since they had been together she had given him
      glimpses of her past that made him angrily long to shelter and defend her
      future. It was intolerable that a spirit as fine as hers should be ever so
      little dulled or diminished by the kind of compromises out of which their
      wretched lives were made. For himself, he didn&rsquo;t care a hang: he had
      composed for his own guidance a rough-and-ready code, a short set of
      &ldquo;mays&rdquo; and &ldquo;mustn&rsquo;ts&rdquo; which immensely simplified his course. There were
      things a fellow put up with for the sake of certain definite and otherwise
      unattainable advantages; there were other things he wouldn&rsquo;t traffic with
      at any price. But for a woman, he began to see, it might be different. The
      temptations might be greater, the cost considerably higher, the dividing
      line between the &ldquo;mays&rdquo; and &ldquo;mustn&rsquo;ts&rdquo; more fluctuating and less sharply
      drawn. Susy, thrown on the world at seventeen, with only a weak wastrel of
      a father to define that treacherous line for her, and with every
      circumstance soliciting her to overstep it, seemed to have been preserved
      chiefly by an innate scorn of most of the objects of human folly. &ldquo;Such
      trash as he went to pieces for,&rdquo; was her curt comment on her parent&rsquo;s
      premature demise: as though she accepted in advance the necessity of
      ruining one&rsquo;s self for something, but was resolved to discriminate firmly
      between what was worth it and what wasn&rsquo;t.
    </p>
    <p>
      This philosophy had at first enchanted Lansing; but now it began to rouse
      vague fears. The fine armour of her fastidiousness had preserved her from
      the kind of risks she had hitherto been exposed to; but what if others,
      more subtle, found a joint in it? Was there, among her delicate
      discriminations, any equivalent to his own rules? Might not her taste for
      the best and rarest be the very instrument of her undoing; and if
      something that wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;trash&rdquo; came her way, would she hesitate a second to
      go to pieces for it?
    </p>
    <p>
      He was determined to stick to the compact that they should do nothing to
      interfere with what each referred to as the other&rsquo;s &ldquo;chance&rdquo;; but what if,
      when hers came, he couldn&rsquo;t agree with her in recognizing it? He wanted
      for her, oh, so passionately, the best; but his conception of that best
      had so insensibly, so subtly been transformed in the light of their first
      month together!
    </p>
    <p>
      His lazy strokes were carrying him slowly shoreward; but the hour was so
      exquisite that a few yards from the landing he laid hold of the mooring
      rope of Streffy&rsquo;s boat and floated there, following his dream.... It was a
      bore to be leaving; no doubt that was what made him turn things inside-out
      so uselessly. Venice would be delicious, of course; but nothing would ever
      again be as sweet as this. And then they had only a year of security
      before them; and of that year a month was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reluctantly he swam ashore, walked up to the house, and pushed open a
      window of the cool painted drawing-room. Signs of departure were already
      visible. There were trunks in the hall, tennis rackets on the stairs; on
      the landing, the cook Giulietta had both arms around a slippery hold-all
      that refused to let itself be strapped. It all gave him a chill sense of
      unreality, as if the past month had been an act on the stage, and its
      setting were being folded away and rolled into the wings to make room for
      another play in which he and Susy had no part.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time he came down again, dressed and hungry, to the terrace where
      coffee awaited him, he had recovered his usual pleasant sense of security.
      Susy was there, fresh and gay, a rose in her breast and the sun in her
      hair: her head was bowed over Bradshaw, but she waved a fond hand across
      the breakfast things, and presently looked up to say: &ldquo;Yes, I believe we
      can just manage it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Manage what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To catch the train at Milan&mdash;if we start in the motor at ten sharp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stared. &ldquo;The motor? What motor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the new people&rsquo;s&mdash;Streffy&rsquo;s tenants. He&rsquo;s never told me their
      name, and the chauffeur says he can&rsquo;t pronounce it. The chauffeur&rsquo;s is
      Ottaviano, anyhow; I&rsquo;ve been making friends with him. He arrived last
      night, and he says they&rsquo;re not due at Como till this evening. He simply
      jumped at the idea of running us over to Milan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord&mdash;&rdquo; said Lansing, when she stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sprang up from the table with a laugh. &ldquo;It will be a scramble; but
      I&rsquo;ll manage it, if you&rsquo;ll go up at once and pitch the last things into
      your trunk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but look here&mdash;have you any idea what it&rsquo;s going to cost?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She raised her eyebrows gaily. &ldquo;Why, a good deal less than our railway
      tickets. Ottaviano&rsquo;s got a sweetheart in Milan, and hasn&rsquo;t seen her for
      six months. When I found that out I knew he&rsquo;d be going there anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was clever of her, and he laughed. But why was it that he had grown to
      shrink from even such harmless evidence of her always knowing how to
      &ldquo;manage&rdquo;? &ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s right: the fellow would
      be sure to be going to Milan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upstairs, on the way to his dressing room, he found her in a cloud of
      finery which her skilful hands were forcibly compressing into a last
      portmanteau. He had never seen anyone pack as cleverly as Susy: the way
      she coaxed reluctant things into a trunk was a symbol of the way she
      fitted discordant facts into her life. &ldquo;When I&rsquo;m rich,&rdquo; she often said,
      &ldquo;the thing I shall hate most will be to see an idiot maid at my trunks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he passed, she glanced over her shoulder, her face pink with the
      struggle, and drew a cigar-box from the depths. &ldquo;Dearest, do put a couple
      of cigars into your pocket as a tip for Ottaviano.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lansing stared. &ldquo;Why, what on earth are you doing with Streffy&rsquo;s cigars?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Packing them, of course.... You don&rsquo;t suppose he meant them for those
      other people?&rdquo; She gave him a look of honest wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whom he meant them for&mdash;but they&rsquo;re not ours....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She continued to look at him wonderingly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what there is to be
      solemn about. The cigars are not Streffy&rsquo;s either... you may be sure he
      got them out of some bounder. And there&rsquo;s nothing he&rsquo;d hate more than to
      have them passed on to another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense. If they&rsquo;re not Streffy&rsquo;s they&rsquo;re much less mine. Hand them
      over, please, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as you like. But it does seem a waste; and, of course, the other
      people will never have one of them.... The gardener and Giulietta&rsquo;s lover
      will see to that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lansing looked away from her at the waves of lace and muslin from which
      she emerged like a rosy Nereid. &ldquo;How many boxes of them are left?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only four.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unpack them, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before she moved there was a pause so full of challenge that Lansing had
      time for an exasperated sense of the disproportion between his anger and
      its cause. And this made him still angrier.
    </p>
    <p>
      She held out a box. &ldquo;The others are in your suitcase downstairs. It&rsquo;s
      locked and strapped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me the key, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We might send them back from Venice, mightn&rsquo;t we? That lock is so nasty:
      it will take you half an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me the key, please.&rdquo; She gave it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went downstairs and battled with the lock, for the allotted half-hour,
      under the puzzled eyes of Giulietta and the sardonic grin of the
      chauffeur, who now and then, from the threshold, politely reminded him how
      long it would take to get to Milan. Finally the key turned, and Lansing,
      broken-nailed and perspiring, extracted the cigars and stalked with them
      into the deserted drawing room. The great bunches of golden roses that he
      and Susy had gathered the day before were dropping their petals on the
      marble embroidery of the floor, pale camellias floated in the alabaster
      tazzas between the windows, haunting scents of the garden blew in on him
      with the breeze from the lake. Never had Streffy&rsquo;s little house seemed so
      like a nest of pleasures. Lansing laid the cigar boxes on a console and
      ran upstairs to collect his last possessions. When he came down again, his
      wife, her eyes brilliant with achievement, was seated in their borrowed
      chariot, the luggage cleverly stowed away, and Giulietta and the gardener
      kissing her hand and weeping out inconsolable farewells.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what she&rsquo;s given them?&rdquo; he thought, as he jumped in beside her
      and the motor whirled them through the nightingale-thickets to the gate.
    </p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

    <p>
      <span class="smcap">Charlie Strefford&rsquo;s</span> villa was like a nest in a rose-bush; the Nelson
      Vanderlyns&rsquo; palace called for loftier analogies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its vastness and splendour seemed, in comparison, oppressive to Susy.
      Their landing, after dark, at the foot of the great shadowy staircase,
      their dinner at a dimly-lit table under a ceiling weighed down with
      Olympians, their chilly evening in a corner of a drawing room where
      minuets should have been danced before a throne, contrasted with the happy
      intimacies of Como as their sudden sense of disaccord contrasted with the
      mutual confidence of the day before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The journey had been particularly jolly: both Susy and Lansing had had too
      long a discipline in the art of smoothing things over not to make a
      special effort to hide from each other the ravages of their first
      disagreement. But, deep down and invisible, the disagreement remained; and
      compunction for having been its cause gnawed at Susy&rsquo;s bosom as she sat in
      her tapestried and vaulted bedroom, brushing her hair before a tarnished
      mirror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I liked grandeur; but this place is really out of scale,&rdquo; she
      mused, watching the reflection of a pale hand move back and forward in the
      dim recesses of the mirror. &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;Ellie Vanderlyn&rsquo;s
      hardly half an inch taller than I am; and she certainly isn&rsquo;t a bit more
      dignified.... I wonder if it&rsquo;s because I feel so horribly small to-night
      that the place seems so horribly big.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She loved luxury: splendid things always made her feel handsome and high
      ceilings arrogant; she did not remember having ever before been oppressed
      by the evidences of wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laid down the brush and leaned her chin on her clasped hands.... Even
      now she could not understand what had made her take the cigars. She had
      always been alive to the value of her inherited scruples: her reasoned
      opinions were unusually free, but with regard to the things one couldn&rsquo;t
      reason about she was oddly tenacious. And yet she had taken Streffy&rsquo;s
      cigars! She had taken them&mdash;yes, that was the point&mdash;she had
      taken them for Nick, because the desire to please him, to make the
      smallest details of his life easy and agreeable and luxurious, had become
      her absorbing preoccupation. She had committed, for him, precisely the
      kind of little baseness she would most have scorned to commit for herself;
      and, since he hadn&rsquo;t instantly felt the difference, she would never be
      able to explain it to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood up with a sigh, shook out her loosened hair, and glanced around
      the great frescoed room. The maid-servant had said something about the
      Signora&rsquo;s having left a letter for her; and there it lay on the
      writing-table, with her mail and Nick&rsquo;s; a thick envelope addressed in
      Ellie&rsquo;s childish scrawl, with a glaring &ldquo;Private&rdquo; dashed across the
      corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth can she have to say, when she hates writing so,&rdquo; Susy
      mused.
    </p>
    <p>
      She broke open the envelope, and four or five stamped and sealed letters
      fell from it. All were addressed, in Ellie&rsquo;s hand, to Nelson Vanderlyn
      Esqre; and in the corner of each was faintly pencilled a number and a
      date: one, two, three, four&mdash;with a week&rsquo;s interval between the
      dates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness&mdash;&rdquo; gasped Susy, understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had dropped into an armchair near the table, and for a long time she
      sat staring at the numbered letters. A sheet of paper covered with Ellie&rsquo;s
      writing had fluttered out among them, but she let it lie; she knew so well
      what it would say! She knew all about her friend, of course; except poor
      old Nelson, who didn&rsquo;t, But she had never imagined that Ellie would dare
      to use her in this way. It was unbelievable... she had never pictured
      anything so vile.... The blood rushed to her face, and she sprang up
      angrily, half minded to tear the letters in bits and throw them all into
      the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      She heard her husband&rsquo;s knock on the door between their rooms, and swept
      the dangerous packet under the blotting-book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, go away, please, there&rsquo;s a dear,&rdquo; she called out; &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t finished
      unpacking, and everything&rsquo;s in such a mess.&rdquo; Gathering up Nick&rsquo;s papers
      and letters, she ran across the room and thrust them through the door.
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s something to keep you quiet,&rdquo; she laughed, shining in on him an
      instant from the threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned back feeling weak with shame. Ellie&rsquo;s letter lay on the floor:
      reluctantly she stooped to pick it up, and one by one the expected phrases
      sprang out at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One good turn deserves another.... Of course you and Nick are welcome to
      stay all summer.... There won&rsquo;t be a particle of expense for you&mdash;the
      servants have orders.... If you&rsquo;ll just be an angel and post these letters
      yourself.... It&rsquo;s been my only chance for such an age; when we meet I&rsquo;ll
      explain everything. And in a month at latest I&rsquo;ll be back to fetch
      Clarissa....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susy lifted the letter to the lamp to be sure she had read aright. To
      fetch Clarissa! Then Ellie&rsquo;s child was here? Here, under the roof with
      them, left to their care? She read on, raging. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s so delighted, poor
      darling, to know you&rsquo;re coming. I&rsquo;ve had to sack her beastly governess for
      impertinence, and if it weren&rsquo;t for you she&rsquo;d be all alone with a lot of
      servants I don&rsquo;t much trust. So for pity&rsquo;s sake be good to my child, and
      forgive me for leaving her. She thinks I&rsquo;ve gone to take a cure; and she
      knows she&rsquo;s not to tell her Daddy that I&rsquo;m away, because it would only
      worry him if he thought I was ill. She&rsquo;s perfectly to be trusted; you&rsquo;ll
      see what a clever angel she is....&rdquo; And then, at the bottom of the page,
      in a last slanting postscript: &ldquo;Susy darling, if you&rsquo;ve ever owed me
      anything in the way of kindness, you won&rsquo;t, on your sacred honour, say a
      word of this to any one, even to Nick. And I know I can count on you to
      rub out the numbers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susy sprang up and tossed Mrs. Vanderlyn&rsquo;s letter into the fire: then she
      came slowly back to the chair. There, at her elbow, lay the four fatal
      envelopes; and her next affair was to make up her mind what to do with
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      To destroy them on the spot had seemed, at first thought, inevitable: it
      might be saving Ellie as well as herself. But such a step seemed to Susy
      to involve departure on the morrow, and this in turn involved notifying
      Ellie, whose letter she had vainly scanned for an address. Well&mdash;perhaps
      Clarissa&rsquo;s nurse would know where one could write to her mother; it was
      unlikely that even Ellie would go off without assuring some means of
      communication with her child. At any rate, there was nothing to be done
      that night: nothing but to work out the details of their flight on the
      morrow, and rack her brains to find a substitute for the hospitality they
      were rejecting. Susy did not disguise from herself how much she had
      counted on the Vanderlyn apartment for the summer: to be able to do so had
      singularly simplified the future. She knew Ellie&rsquo;s largeness of hand, and
      had been sure in advance that as long as they were her guests their only
      expense would be an occasional present to the servants. And what would the
      alternative be? She and Lansing, in their endless talks, had so lived
      themselves into the vision of indolent summer days on the lagoon, of
      flaming hours on the beach of the Lido, and evenings of music and dreams
      on their broad balcony above the Giudecca, that the idea of having to
      renounce these joys, and deprive her Nick of them, filled Susy with a
      wrath intensified by his having confided in her that when they were
      quietly settled in Venice he &ldquo;meant to write.&rdquo; Already nascent in her
      breast was the fierce resolve of the author&rsquo;s wife to defend her husband&rsquo;s
      privacy and facilitate his encounters with the Muse. It was abominable,
      simply abominable, that Ellie Vanderlyn should have drawn her into such a
      trap!
    </p>
    <p>
      Well&mdash;there was nothing for it but to make a clean breast of the
      whole thing to Nick. The trivial incident of the cigars&mdash;how trivial it now
      seemed!&mdash;showed her the kind of stand he would take, and communicated
      to her something of his own uncompromising energy. She would tell him the
      whole story in the morning, and try to find a way out with him: Susy&rsquo;s
      faith in her power of finding a way out was inexhaustible. But suddenly
      she remembered the adjuration at the end of Mrs. Vanderlyn&rsquo;s letter: &ldquo;If
      you&rsquo;re ever owed me anything in the way of kindness, you won&rsquo;t, on your
      sacred honour, say a word to Nick....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was, of course, exactly what no one had the right to ask of her: if
      indeed the word &ldquo;right&rdquo;, could be used in any conceivable relation to this
      coil of wrongs. But the fact remained that, in the way of kindness, she
      did owe much to Ellie; and that this was the first payment her friend had
      ever exacted. She found herself, in fact, in exactly the same position as
      when Ursula Gillow, using the same argument, had appealed to her to give
      up Nick Lansing. Yes, Susy reflected; but then Nelson Vanderlyn had been
      kind to her too; and the money Ellie had been so kind with was
      Nelson&rsquo;s.... The queer edifice of Susy&rsquo;s standards tottered on its base
      she honestly didn&rsquo;t know where fairness lay, as between so much that was
      foul.
    </p>
    <p>
      The very depth of her perplexity puzzled her. She had been in &ldquo;tight
      places&rdquo; before; had indeed been in so few that were not, in one way or
      another, constricting! As she looked back on her past it lay before her as
      a very network of perpetual concessions and contrivings. But never before
      had she had such a sense of being tripped up, gagged and pinioned. The
      little misery of the cigars still galled her, and now this big humiliation
      superposed itself on the raw wound. Decidedly, the second month of their
      honey-moon was beginning cloudily....
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced at the enamel led travelling-clock on her dressing table&mdash;one
      of the few wedding-presents she had consented to accept in kind&mdash;and
      was startled at the lateness of the hour. In a moment Nick would be
      coming; and an uncomfortable sensation in her throat warned her that
      through sheer nervousness and exasperation she might blurt out something
      ill-advised. The old habit of being always on her guard made her turn once
      more to the looking-glass. Her face was pale and haggard; and having, by a
      swift and skilful application of cosmetics, increased its appearance of
      fatigue, she crossed the room and softly opened her husband&rsquo;s door.
    </p>
    <p>
      He too sat by a lamp, reading a letter which he put aside as she entered.
      His face was grave, and she said to herself that he was certainly still
      thinking about the cigars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very tired, dearest, and my head aches so horribly that I&rsquo;ve come to
      bid you good-night.&rdquo; Bending over the back of his chair, she laid her arms
      on his shoulders. He lifted his hands to clasp hers, but, as he threw his
      head back to smile up at her she noticed that his look was still serious,
      almost remote. It was as if, for the first time, a faint veil hung between
      his eyes and hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry: it&rsquo;s been a long day for you,&rdquo; he said absently, pressing
      his lips to her hands
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt the dreaded twitch in her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nick!&rdquo; she burst out, tightening her embrace, &ldquo;before I go, you&rsquo;ve got to
      swear to me on your honour that you know I should never have taken those
      cigars for myself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment he stared at her, and she stared back at him with equal
      gravity; then the same irresistible mirth welled up in both, and Susy&rsquo;s
      compunctions were swept away on a gale of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she woke the next morning the sun was pouring in between her curtains
      of old brocade, and its refraction from the ripples of the Canal was
      drawing a network of golden scales across the vaulted ceiling. The maid
      had just placed a tray on a slim marquetry table near the bed, and over
      the edge of the tray Susy discovered the small serious face of Clarissa
      Vanderlyn. At the sight of the little girl all her dormant qualms awoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clarissa was just eight, and small for her age: her little round chin was
      barely on a level with the tea-service, and her clear brown eyes gazed at
      Susy between the ribs of the toast-rack and the single tea-rose in an old
      Murano glass. Susy had not seen her for two years, and she seemed, in the
      interval, to have passed from a thoughtful infancy to complete ripeness of
      feminine experience. She was looking with approval at her mother&rsquo;s guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;ve come,&rdquo; she said in a small sweet voice. &ldquo;I like you so
      very much. I know I&rsquo;m not to be often with you; but at least you&rsquo;ll have
      an eye on me, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An eye on you! I shall never want to have it off you, if you say such
      nice things to me!&rdquo; Susy laughed, leaning from her pillows to draw the
      little girl up to her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clarissa smiled and settled herself down comfortably on the silken
      bedspread. &ldquo;Oh, I know I&rsquo;m not to be always about, because you&rsquo;re just
      married; but could you see to it that I have my meals regularly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you poor darling! Don&rsquo;t you always?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not when mother&rsquo;s away on these cures. The servants don&rsquo;t always obey me:
      you see I&rsquo;m so little for my age. In a few years, of course, they&rsquo;ll have
      to&mdash;even if I don&rsquo;t grow much,&rdquo; she added judiciously. She put out
      her hand and touched the string of pearls about Susy&rsquo;s throat. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
      small, but they&rsquo;re very good. I suppose you don&rsquo;t take the others when you
      travel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The others? Bless you! I haven&rsquo;t any others&mdash;and never shall have,
      probably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No other pearls?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No other jewels at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clarissa stared. &ldquo;Is that really true?&rdquo; she asked, as if in the presence
      of the unprecedented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Awfully true,&rdquo; Susy confessed. &ldquo;But I think I can make the servants obey
      me all the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This point seemed to have lost its interest for Clarissa, who was still
      gravely scrutinizing her companion. After a while she brought forth
      another question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you have to give up all your jewels when you were divorced?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Divorced&mdash;?&rdquo; Susy threw her head back against the pillows and
      laughed. &ldquo;Why, what are you thinking of? Don&rsquo;t you remember that I wasn&rsquo;t
      even married the last time you saw me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I do. But that was two years ago.&rdquo; The little girl wound her arms
      about Susy&rsquo;s neck and leaned against her caressingly. &ldquo;Are you going to be
      soon, then? I&rsquo;ll promise not to tell if you don&rsquo;t want me to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going to be divorced? Of course not! What in the world made you think so?
      &rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you look so awfully happy,&rdquo; said Clarissa Vanderlyn simply.
    </p>


<h3>V.</h3>

    <p>
      <span class="smcap">It</span> was a trifling enough sign, but it had remained in Susy&rsquo;s mind: that
      first morning in Venice Nick had gone out without first coming in to see
      her. She had stayed in bed late, chatting with Clarissa, and expecting to
      see the door open and her husband appear; and when the child left, and she
      had jumped up and looked into Nick&rsquo;s room, she found it empty, and a line
      on his dressing table informed her that he had gone out to send a
      telegram.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was lover-like, and even boyish, of him to think it necessary to
      explain his absence; but why had he not simply come in and told her! She
      instinctively connected the little fact with the shade of preoccupation
      she had noticed on his face the night before, when she had gone to his
      room and found him absorbed in letter; and while she dressed she had
      continued to wonder what was in the letter, and whether the telegram he
      had hurried out to send was an answer to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had never found out. When he reappeared, handsome and happy as the
      morning, he proffered no explanation; and it was part of her life-long
      policy not to put uncalled-for questions. It was not only that her jealous
      regard for her own freedom was matched by an equal respect for that of
      others; she had steered too long among the social reefs and shoals not to
      know how narrow is the passage that leads to peace of mind, and she was
      determined to keep her little craft in mid-channel. But the incident had
      lodged itself in her memory, acquiring a sort of symbolic significance, as
      of a turning-point in her relations with her husband. Not that these were
      less happy, but that she now beheld them, as she had always formerly
      beheld such joys, as an unstable islet in a sea of storms. Her present
      bliss was as complete as ever, but it was ringed by the perpetual menace
      of all she knew she was hiding from Nick, and of all she suspected him of
      hiding from her....
    </p>
    <p>
      She was thinking of these things one afternoon about three weeks after
      their arrival in Venice. It was near sunset, and she sat alone on the
      balcony, watching the cross-lights on the water weave their pattern above
      the flushed reflection of old palace-basements. She was almost always
      alone at that hour. Nick had taken to writing in the afternoons&mdash;he
      had been as good as his word, and so, apparently, had the Muse and it was
      his habit to join his wife only at sunset, for a late row on the lagoon.
      She had taken Clarissa, as usual, to the Giardino Pubblico, where that
      obliging child had politely but indifferently &ldquo;played&rdquo;&mdash;Clarissa
      joined in the diversions of her age as if conforming to an obsolete
      tradition&mdash;and had brought her back for a music lesson, echoes of
      which now drifted down from a distant window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Susy had come to be extremely thankful for Clarissa. But for the little
      girl, her pride in her husband&rsquo;s industry might have been tinged with a
      faint sense of being at times left out and forgotten; and as Nick&rsquo;s
      industry was the completest justification for their being where they were,
      and for her having done what she had, she was grateful to Clarissa for
      helping her to feel less alone. Clarissa, indeed, represented the other
      half of her justification: it was as much on the child&rsquo;s account as on
      Nick&rsquo;s that Susy had held her tongue, remained in Venice, and slipped out
      once a week to post one of Ellie&rsquo;s numbered letters. A day&rsquo;s experience of
      the Palazzo Vanderlyn had convinced Susy of the impossibility of deserting
      Clarissa. Long experience had shown her that the most crowded households
      often contain the loneliest nurseries, and that the rich child is exposed
      to evils unknown to less pampered infancy; but hitherto such things had
      merely been to her one of the uglier bits in the big muddled pattern of
      life. Now she found herself feeling where before she had only judged: her
      precarious bliss came to her charged with a new weight of pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was thinking of these things, and of the approaching date of Ellie
      Vanderlyn&rsquo;s return, and of the searching truths she was storing up for
      that lady&rsquo;s private ear, when she noticed a gondola turning its prow
      toward the steps below the balcony. She leaned over, and a tall gentleman
      in shabby clothes, glancing up at her as he jumped out, waved a mouldy
      Panama in joyful greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Streffy!&rdquo; she exclaimed as joyfully; and she was half-way down the stairs
      when he ran up them followed by his luggage-laden boatman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, I suppose?&mdash;Ellie said I might come,&rdquo; he explained
      in a shrill cheerful voice; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m to have my same green room with the
      parrot-panels, because its furniture is already so frightfully stained
      with my hair-wash.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susy was beaming on him with the deep sense of satisfaction which his
      presence always produced in his friends. There was no one in the world,
      they all agreed, half as ugly and untidy and delightful as Streffy; no one
      who combined such outspoken selfishness with such imperturbable good
      humour; no one who knew so well how to make you believe he was being
      charming to you when it was you who were being charming to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to these seductions, of which none estimated the value more
      accurately than their possessor, Strefford had for Susy another attraction
      of which he was probably unconscious. It was that of being the one rooted
      and stable being among the fluid and shifting figures that composed her
      world. Susy had always lived among people so denationalized that those one
      took for Russians generally turned out to be American, and those one was
      inclined to ascribe to New York proved to have originated in Rome or
      Bucharest. These cosmopolitan people, who, in countries not their own,
      lived in houses as big as hotels, or in hotels where the guests were as
      international as the waiters, had inter-married, inter-loved and
      inter-divorced each other over the whole face of Europe, and according to
      every code that attempts to regulate human ties. Strefford, too, had his
      home in this world, but only one of his homes. The other, the one he spoke
      of, and probably thought of, least often, was a great dull English
      country-house in a northern county, where a life as monotonous and
      self-contained as his own was chequered and dispersed had gone on for
      generation after generation; and it was the sense of that house, and of
      all it typified even to his vagrancy and irreverence, which, coming out
      now and then in his talk, or in his attitude toward something or somebody,
      gave him a firmer outline and a steadier footing than the other
      marionettes in the dance. Superficially so like them all, and so eager to
      outdo them in detachment and adaptability, ridiculing the prejudices he
      had shaken off, and the people to whom he belonged, he still kept, under
      his easy pliancy, the skeleton of old faiths and old fashions. &ldquo;He talks
      every language as well as the rest of us,&rdquo; Susy had once said of him, &ldquo;but
      at least he talks one language better than the others&rdquo;; and Strefford,
      told of the remark, had laughed, called her an idiot, and been pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he shambled up the stairs with her, arm in arm, she was thinking of
      this quality with a new appreciation of its value. Even she and Lansing,
      in spite of their unmixed Americanism, their substantial background of
      old-fashioned cousinships in New York and Philadelphia, were as mentally
      detached, as universally at home, as touts at an International Exhibition.
      If they were usually recognized as Americans it was only because they
      spoke French so well, and because Nick was too fair to be &ldquo;foreign,&rdquo; and
      too sharp-featured to be English. But Charlie Strefford was English with
      all the strength of an inveterate habit; and something in Susy was slowly
      waking to a sense of the beauty of habit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lounging on the balcony, whither he had followed her without pausing to
      remove the stains of travel, Strefford showed himself immensely interested
      in the last chapter of her history, greatly pleased at its having been
      enacted under his roof, and hugely and flippantly amused at the firmness
      with which she refused to let him see Nick till the latter&rsquo;s daily task
      was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Writing? Rot! What&rsquo;s he writing? He&rsquo;s breaking you in, my dear; that&rsquo;s
      what he&rsquo;s doing: establishing an alibi. What&rsquo;ll you bet he&rsquo;s just sitting
      there smoking and reading Le Rire? Let&rsquo;s go and see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Susy was firm. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s read me his first chapter: it&rsquo;s wonderful. It&rsquo;s a
      philosophic romance&mdash;rather like Marius, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;I do!&rdquo; said Strefford, with a laugh that she thought
      idiotic.
    </p>
    <p>
      She flushed up like a child. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re stupid, Streffy. You forget that Nick
      and I don&rsquo;t need alibis. We&rsquo;ve got rid of all that hyprocrisy by agreeing
      that each will give the other a hand up when either of us wants a change.
      We&rsquo;ve not married to spy and lie, and nag each other; we&rsquo;ve formed a
      partnership for our mutual advantage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see; that&rsquo;s capital. But how can you be sure that, when Nick wants a
      change, you&rsquo;ll consider it for his advantage to have one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the point that had always secretly tormented Susy; she often
      wondered if it equally tormented Nick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope I shall have enough common sense&mdash;&rdquo; she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, of course: common sense is what you&rsquo;re both bound to base your
      argument on, whichever way you argue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This flash of insight disconcerted her, and she said, a little irritably:
      &ldquo;What should you do then, if you married?&mdash;Hush, Streffy! I forbid
      you to shout like that&mdash;all the gondolas are stopping to look!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I help it?&rdquo; He rocked backward and forward in his chair. &ldquo;&lsquo;If you
      marry,&rsquo; she says: &lsquo;Streffy, what have you decided to do if you suddenly
      become a raving maniac?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said no such thing. If your uncle and your cousin died, you&rsquo;d marry
      to-morrow; you know you would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, now you&rsquo;re talking business.&rdquo; He folded his long arms and leaned over
      the balcony, looking down at the dusky ripples streaked with fire. &ldquo;In
      that case I should say: &lsquo;Susan, my dear&mdash;Susan&mdash;now that by the
      merciful intervention of Providence you have become Countess of Altringham
      in the peerage of Great Britain, and Baroness Dunsterville and d&rsquo;Amblay in
      the peerages of Ireland and Scotland, I&rsquo;ll thank you to remember that you
      are a member of one of the most ancient houses in the United Kingdom&mdash;and
      not to get found out.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susy laughed. &ldquo;We know what those warnings mean! I pity my namesake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He swung about and gave her a quick look out of his small ugly twinkling
      eyes. &ldquo;Is there any other woman in the world named Susan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so, if the name&rsquo;s an essential. Even if Nick chucks me, don&rsquo;t
      count on me to carry out that programme. I&rsquo;ve seen it in practice too
      often.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well: as far as I know, everybody&rsquo;s in perfect health at Altringham.&rdquo;
       He fumbled in his pocket and drew out a fountain pen, a handkerchief over
      which it had leaked, and a packet of dishevelled cigarettes. Lighting one,
      and restoring the other objects to his pocket, he continued calmly: &ldquo;Tell
      me how did you manage to smooth things over with the Gillows? Ursula was
      running amuck when I was in Newport last Summer; it was just when people
      were beginning to say that you were going to marry Nick. I was afraid
      she&rsquo;d put a spoke in your wheel; and I hear she put a big cheque in your
      hand instead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susy was silent. From the first moment of Strefford&rsquo;s appearance she had
      known that in the course of time he would put that question. He was as
      inquisitive as a monkey, and when he had made up his mind to find out
      anything it was useless to try to divert his attention. After a moment&rsquo;s
      hesitation she said: &ldquo;I flirted with Fred. It was a bore but he was very
      decent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would be&mdash;poor Fred. And you got Ursula thoroughly frightened!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;enough. And then luckily that young Nerone Altineri turned up
      from Rome: he went over to New York to look for a job as an engineer, and
      Ursula made Fred put him in their iron works.&rdquo; She paused again, and then
      added abruptly: &ldquo;Streffy! If you knew how I hate that kind of thing. I&rsquo;d
      rather have Nick come in now and tell me frankly, as I know he would, that
      he&rsquo;s going off with&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With Coral Hicks?&rdquo; Strefford suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed. &ldquo;Poor Coral Hicks! What on earth made you think of the
      Hickses?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I caught a glimpse of them the other day at Capri. They&rsquo;re
      cruising about: they said they were coming in here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a nuisance! I do hope they won&rsquo;t find us out. They were awfully kind
      to Nick when he went to India with them, and they&rsquo;re so simple-minded that
      they would expect him to be glad to see them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Strefford aimed his cigarette-end at a tourist on a puggaree who was
      gazing up from his guidebook at the palace. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he murmured with
      satisfaction, seeing the shot take effect; then he added: &ldquo;Coral Hicks is
      growing up rather pretty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Streff&mdash;you&rsquo;re dreaming! That lump of a girl with spectacles and
      thick ankles! Poor Mrs. Hicks used to say to Nick: &lsquo;When Mr. Hicks and I
      had Coral educated we presumed culture was in greater demand in Europe
      than it appears to be.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll see: that girl&rsquo;s education won&rsquo;t interfere with her, once
      she&rsquo;s started. So then: if Nick came in and told you he was going off&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be so thankful if it was with a fright like Coral! But you
      know,&rdquo; she added with a smile, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve agreed that it&rsquo;s not to happen for a
      year.&rdquo;
     </p>


<h3>VI.</h3>

    <p>
      <span class="smcap">Susy</span> found Strefford, after his first burst of nonsense, unusually kind
      and responsive. The interest he showed in her future and Nick&rsquo;s seemed to
      proceed not so much from his habitual spirit of scientific curiosity as
      from simple friendliness. He was privileged to see Nick&rsquo;s first chapter,
      of which he formed so favourable an impression that he spoke sternly to
      Susy on the importance of respecting her husband&rsquo;s working hours; and he
      even carried his general benevolence to the length of showing a fatherly
      interest in Clarissa Vanderlyn. He was always charming to children, but
      fitfully and warily, with an eye on his independence, and on the
      possibility of being suddenly bored by them; Susy had never seen him
      abandon these precautions so completely as he did with Clarissa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor little devil! Who looks after her when you and Nick are off
      together? Do you mean to tell me Ellie sacked the governess and went away
      without having anyone to take her place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think she expected me to do it,&rdquo; said Susy with a touch of asperity.
      There were moments when her duty to Clarissa weighed on her somewhat
      heavily; whenever she went off alone with Nick she was pursued by the
      vision of a little figure waving wistful farewells from the balcony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s like Ellie: you might have known she&rsquo;d get an equivalent when
      she lent you all this. But I don&rsquo;t believe she thought you&rsquo;d be so
      conscientious about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susy considered. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose she did; and perhaps I shouldn&rsquo;t have
      been, a year ago. But you see&rdquo;&mdash;she hesitated&mdash;&ldquo;Nick&rsquo;s so
      awfully good: it&rsquo;s made me look; at a lot of things differently....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, hang Nick&rsquo;s goodness! It&rsquo;s happiness that&rsquo;s done it, my dear. You&rsquo;re
      just one of the people with whom it happens to agree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susy, leaning back, scrutinized between her lashes his crooked ironic
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it that&rsquo;s agreeing with you, Streffy? I&rsquo;ve never seen you so
      human. You must be getting an outrageous price for the villa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Strefford laughed and clapped his hand on his breast-pocket. &ldquo;I should be
      an ass not to: I&rsquo;ve got a wire here saying they must have it for another
      month at any price.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What luck! I&rsquo;m so glad. Who are they, by the way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew himself up out of the long chair in which he was disjointedly
      lounging, and looked down at her with a smile. &ldquo;Another couple of
      love-sick idiots like you and Nick.... I say, before I spend it all let&rsquo;s
      go out and buy something ripping for Clarissa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The days passed so quickly and radiantly that, but for her concern for
      Clarissa, Susy would hardly have been conscious of her hostess&rsquo;s
      protracted absence. Mrs. Vanderlyn had said: &ldquo;Four weeks at the latest,&rdquo;
       and the four weeks were over, and she had neither arrived nor written to
      explain her non-appearance. She had, in fact, given no sign of life since
      her departure, save in the shape of a post-card which had reached Clarissa
      the day after the Lansings&rsquo; arrival, and in which Mrs. Vanderlyn
      instructed her child to be awfully good, and not to forget to feed the
      mongoose. Susy noticed that this missive had been posted in Milan.
    </p>
    <p>
      She communicated her apprehensions to Strefford. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t trust that
      green-eyed nurse. She&rsquo;s forever with the younger gondolier; and Clarissa&rsquo;s
      so awfully sharp. I don&rsquo;t see why Ellie hasn&rsquo;t come: she was due last
      Monday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her companion laughed, and something in the sound of his laugh suggested
      that he probably knew as much of Ellie&rsquo;s movements as she did, if not
      more. The sense of disgust which the subject always roused in her made her
      look away quickly from his tolerant smile. She would have given the world,
      at that moment, to have been free to tell Nick what she had learned on the
      night of their arrival, and then to have gone away with him, no matter
      where. But there was Clarissa&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      To fortify herself against the temptation, she resolutely fixed her
      thoughts on her husband. Of Nick&rsquo;s beatitude there could be no doubt. He
      adored her, he revelled in Venice, he rejoiced in his work; and concerning
      the quality of that work her judgment was as confident as her heart. She
      still doubted if he would ever earn a living by what he wrote, but she no
      longer doubted that he would write something remarkable. The mere fact
      that he was engaged on a philosophic romance, and not a mere novel, seemed
      the proof of an intrinsic superiority. And if she had mistrusted her
      impartiality Strefford&rsquo;s approval would have reassured her. Among their
      friends Strefford passed as an authority on such matters: in summing him
      up his eulogists always added: &ldquo;And you know he writes.&rdquo; As a matter of
      fact, the paying public had remained cold to his few published pages; but
      he lived among the kind of people who confuse taste with talent, and are
      impressed by the most artless attempts at literary expression; and though
      he affected to disdain their judgment, and his own efforts, Susy knew he
      was not sorry to have it said of him: &ldquo;Oh, if only Streffy had chosen&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Strefford&rsquo;s approval of the philosophic romance convinced her that it had
      been worth while staying in Venice for Nick&rsquo;s sake; and if only Ellie
      would come back, and carry off Clarissa to St. Moritz or Deauville, the
      disagreeable episode on which their happiness was based would vanish like
      a cloud, and leave them to complete enjoyment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ellie did not come; but the Mortimer Hickses did, and Nick Lansing was
      assailed by the scruples his wife had foreseen. Strefford, coming back one
      evening from the Lido, reported having recognized the huge outline of the
      Ibis among the pleasure craft of the outer harbour; and the very next
      evening, as the guests of Palazzo Vanderlyn were sipping their ices at
      Florian&rsquo;s, the Hickses loomed up across the Piazza.
    </p>
    <p>
      Susy pleaded in vain with her husband in defence of his privacy. &ldquo;Remember
      you&rsquo;re here to write, dearest; it&rsquo;s your duty not to let any one interfere
      with that. Why shouldn&rsquo;t we tell them we&rsquo;re just leaving!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s no use: we&rsquo;re sure to be always meeting them. And besides,
      I&rsquo;ll be hanged if I&rsquo;m going to shirk the Hickses. I spent five whole
      months on the Ibis, and if they bored me occasionally, India didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make them take us to Aquileia anyhow,&rdquo; said Strefford
      philosophically; and the next moment the Hickses were bearing down on the
      defenceless trio.
    </p>
    <p>
      They presented a formidable front, not only because of their mere physical
      bulk&mdash;Mr. and Mrs. Hicks were equally and majestically
      three-dimensional&mdash;but because they never moved abroad without the
      escort of two private secretaries (one for the foreign languages), Mr.
      Hicks&rsquo;s doctor, a maiden lady known as Eldoradder Tooker, who was Mrs.
      Hicks&rsquo;s cousin and stenographer, and finally their daughter, Coral Hicks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coral Hicks, when Susy had last encountered the party, had been a fat
      spectacled school-girl, always lagging behind her parents, with a
      reluctant poodle in her wake. Now the poodle had gone, and his mistress
      led the procession. The fat school-girl had changed into a young lady of
      compact if not graceful outline; a long-handled eyeglass had replaced the
      spectacles, and through it, instead of a sullen glare, Miss Coral Hicks
      projected on the world a glance at once confident and critical. She looked
      so strong and so assured that Susy, taking her measure in a flash, saw
      that her position at the head of the procession was not fortuitous, and
      murmured inwardly: &ldquo;Thank goodness she&rsquo;s not pretty too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If she was not pretty, she was well-dressed; and if she was overeducated,
      she seemed capable, as Strefford had suggested, of carrying off even this
      crowning disadvantage. At any rate, she was above disguising it; and
      before the whole party had been seated five minutes in front of a fresh
      supply of ices (with Eldorada and the secretaries at a table slightly in
      the background) she had taken up with Nick the question of exploration in
      Mesopotamia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Queer child, Coral,&rdquo; he said to Susy that night as they smoked a last
      cigarette on their balcony. &ldquo;She told me this afternoon that she&rsquo;d
      remembered lots of things she heard me say in India. I thought at the time
      that she cared only for caramels and picture-puzzles, but it seems she was
      listening to everything, and reading all the books she could lay her hands
      on; and she got so bitten with Oriental archaeology that she took a course
      last year at Bryn Mawr. She means to go to Bagdad next spring, and back by
      the Persian plateau and Turkestan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susy laughed luxuriously: she was sitting with her hand in Nick&rsquo;s, while
      the late moon&mdash;theirs again&mdash;rounded its orange-coloured glory
      above the belfry of San Giorgio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Coral! How dreary&mdash;&rdquo; Susy murmured
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dreary? Why? A trip like that is about as well worth doing as anything I
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I meant: dreary to do it without you or me,&rdquo; she laughed, getting up
      lazily to go indoors. A broad band of moonlight, dividing her room onto
      two shadowy halves, lay on the painted Venetian bed with its folded-back
      sheet, its old damask coverlet and lace-edged pillows. She felt the warmth
      of Nick&rsquo;s enfolding arm and lifted her face to his.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hickses retained the most tender memory of Nick&rsquo;s sojourn on the Ibis,
      and Susy, moved by their artless pleasure in meeting him again, was glad
      he had not followed her advice and tried to elude them. She had always
      admired Strefford&rsquo;s ruthless talent for using and discarding the human
      material in his path, but now she began to hope that Nick would not
      remember her suggestion that he should mete out that measure to the
      Hickses. Even if it had been less pleasant to have a big yacht at their
      door during the long golden days and the nights of silver fire, the
      Hickses&rsquo; admiration for Nick would have made Susy suffer them gladly. She
      even began to be aware of a growing liking for them, a liking inspired by
      the very characteristics that would once have provoked her disapproval.
      Susy had had plenty of training in liking common people with big purses;
      in such cases her stock of allowances and extenuations was inexhaustible.
      But they had to be successful common people; and the trouble was that the
      Hickses, judged by her standards, were failures. It was not only that they
      were ridiculous; so, heaven knew, were many of their rivals. But the
      Hickses were both ridiculous and unsuccessful. They had consistently
      resisted the efforts of the experienced advisers who had first descried
      them on the horizon and tried to help them upward. They were always taking
      up the wrong people, giving the wrong kind of party, and spending millions
      on things that nobody who mattered cared about. They all believed
      passionately in &ldquo;movements&rdquo; and &ldquo;causes&rdquo; and &ldquo;ideals,&rdquo; and were always
      attended by the exponents of their latest beliefs, always asking you to
      hear lectures by haggard women in peplums, and having their portraits
      painted by wild people who never turned out to be the fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this would formerly have increased Susy&rsquo;s contempt; now she found
      herself liking the Hickses most for their failings. She was touched by
      their simple good faith, their isolation in the midst of all their queer
      apostles and parasites, their way of drifting about an alien and
      indifferent world in a compactly clinging group of which Eldorada Tooker,
      the doctor and the two secretaries formed the outer fringe, and by their
      view of themselves as a kind of collective re-incarnation of some past
      state of princely culture, symbolised for Mrs. Hicks in what she called
      &ldquo;the court of the Renaissance.&rdquo; Eldorada, of course, was their chief
      prophetess; but even the intensely &ldquo;bright&rdquo; and modern young secretaries,
      Mr. Beck and Mr. Buttles, showed a touching tendency to share her view,
      and spoke of Mr. Hicks as &ldquo;promoting art,&rdquo; in the spirit of Pandolfino
      celebrating the munificence of the Medicis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting really fond of the Hickses; I believe I should be nice to
      them even if they were staying at Danieli&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Susy said to Strefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And even if you owned the yacht?&rdquo; he answered; and for once his banter
      struck her as beside the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ibis carried them, during the endless June days, far and wide along
      the enchanted shores; they roamed among the Euganeans, they saw Aquileia
      and Pomposa and Ravenna. Their hosts would gladly have taken them farther,
      across the Adriatic and on into the golden network of the Aegean; but Susy
      resisted this infraction of Nick&rsquo;s rules, and he himself preferred to
      stick to his task. Only now he wrote in the early mornings, so that on
      most days they could set out before noon and steam back late to the low
      fringe of lights on the lagoon. His work continued to progress, and as
      page was added to page Susy obscurely but surely perceived that each one
      corresponded with a hidden secretion of energy, the gradual forming within
      him of something that might eventually alter both their lives. In what
      sense she could not conjecture: she merely felt that the fact of his
      having chosen a job and stuck to it, if only through a few rosy summer
      weeks, had already given him a new way of saying &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>


<h3>VII.</h3>

    <p>
      <span class="smcap">Of</span> some new ferment at work in him Nick Lansing himself was equally aware.
      He was a better judge of the book he was trying to write than either Susy
      or Strefford; he knew its weaknesses, its treacheries, its tendency to
      slip through his fingers just as he thought his grasp tightest; but he
      knew also that at the very moment when it seemed to have failed him it
      would suddenly be back, beating its loud wings in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had no delusions as to its commercial value, and had winced more than
      he triumphed when Susy produced her allusion to Marius. His book was to be
      called The Pageant of Alexander. His imagination had been enchanted by the
      idea of picturing the young conqueror&rsquo;s advance through the fabulous
      landscapes of Asia: he liked writing descriptions, and vaguely felt that
      under the guise of fiction he could develop his theory of Oriental
      influences in Western art at the expense of less learning than if he had
      tried to put his ideas into an essay. He knew enough of his subject to
      know that he did not know enough to write about it; but he consoled
      himself by remembering that Wilhelm Meister has survived many weighty
      volumes on aesthetics; and between his moments of self-disgust he took
      himself at Susy&rsquo;s valuation, and found an unmixed joy in his task.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never&mdash;no, never!&mdash;had he been so boundlessly, so confidently
      happy. His hack-work had given him the habit of application, and now habit
      wore the glow of inspiration. His previous literary ventures had been
      timid and tentative: if this one was growing and strengthening on his
      hands, it must be because the conditions were so different. He was at
      ease, he was secure, he was satisfied; and he had also, for the first time
      since his early youth, before his mother&rsquo;s death, the sense of having some
      one to look after, some one who was his own particular care, and to whom
      he was answerable for himself and his actions, as he had never felt
      himself answerable to the hurried and indifferent people among whom he had
      chosen to live.
    </p>
    <p>
      Susy had the same standards as these people: she spoke their language,
      though she understood others, she required their pleasures if she did not
      revere their gods. But from the moment that she had become his property he
      had built up in himself a conception of her answering to some deep-seated
      need of veneration. She was his, he had chosen her, she had taken her
      place in the long line of Lansing women who had been loved, honoured, and
      probably deceived, by bygone Lansing men. He didn&rsquo;t pretend to understand
      the logic of it; but the fact that she was his wife gave purpose and
      continuity to his scattered impulses, and a mysterious glow of
      consecration to his task.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once or twice, in the first days of his marriage, he had asked himself
      with a slight shiver what would happen if Susy should begin to bore him.
      The thing had happened to him with other women as to whom his first
      emotions had not differed in intensity from those she inspired. The part
      he had played in his previous love-affairs might indeed have been summed
      up in the memorable line: &ldquo;I am the hunter and the prey,&rdquo; for he had
      invariably ceased to be the first only to regard himself as the second.
      This experience had never ceased to cause him the liveliest pain, since
      his sympathy for his pursuer was only less keen than his commiseration for
      himself; but as he was always a little sorrier for himself, he had always
      ended by distancing the pursuer.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these pre-natal experiences now seemed utterly inapplicable to the new
      man he had become. He could not imagine being bored by Susy&mdash;or
      trying to escape from her if he were. He could not think of her as an
      enemy, or even as an accomplice, since accomplices are potential enemies:
      she was some one with whom, by some unheard-of miracle, joys above the
      joys of friendship were to be tasted, but who, even through these fleeting
      ecstasies, remained simply and securely his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      These new feelings did not affect his general attitude toward life: they
      merely confirmed his faith in its ultimate &ldquo;jolliness.&rdquo; Never had he more
      thoroughly enjoyed the things he had always enjoyed. A good dinner had
      never been as good to him, a beautiful sunset as beautiful; he still
      rejoiced in the fact that he appreciated both with an equal acuity. He was
      as proud as ever of Susy&rsquo;s cleverness and freedom from prejudice: she
      couldn&rsquo;t be too &ldquo;modern&rdquo; for him now that she was his. He shared to the
      full her passionate enjoyment of the present, and all her feverish
      eagerness to make it last. He knew when she was thinking of ways of
      extending their golden opportunity, and he secretly thought with her,
      wondering what new means they could devise. He was thankful that Ellie
      Vanderlyn was still absent, and began to hope they might have the palace
      to themselves for the remainder of the summer. If they did, he would have
      time to finish his book, and Susy to lay up a little interest on their
      wedding cheques; and thus their enchanted year might conceivably be
      prolonged to two.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late as the season was, their presence and Strefford&rsquo;s in Venice had
      already drawn thither several wandering members of their set. It was
      characteristic of these indifferent but agglutinative people that they
      could never remain long parted from each other without a dim sense of
      uneasiness. Lansing was familiar with the feeling. He had known slight
      twinges of it himself, and had often ministered to its qualms in others.
      It was hardly stronger than the faint gnawing which recalls the tea-hour
      to one who has lunched well and is sure of dining as abundantly; but it
      gave a purpose to the purposeless, and helped many hesitating spirits over
      the annual difficulty of deciding between Deauville and St. Moritz,
      Biarritz and Capri.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nick was not surprised to learn that it was becoming the fashion, that
      summer, to pop down to Venice and take a look at the Lansings. Streffy had
      set the example, and Streffy&rsquo;s example was always followed. And then
      Susy&rsquo;s marriage was still a subject of sympathetic speculation. People
      knew the story of the wedding cheques, and were interested in seeing how
      long they could be made to last. It was going to be the thing, that year,
      to help prolong the honey-moon by pressing houses on the adventurous
      couple. Before June was over a band of friends were basking with the
      Lansings on the Lido.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nick found himself unexpectedly disturbed by their arrival. To avoid
      comment and banter he put his book aside and forbade Susy to speak of it,
      explaining to her that he needed an interval of rest. His wife instantly
      and exaggeratedly adopted this view, guarding him from the temptation to
      work as jealously as she had discouraged him from idling; and he was
      careful not to let her find out that the change in his habits coincided
      with his having reached a difficult point in his book. But though he was
      not sorry to stop writing he found himself unexpectedly oppressed by the
      weight of his leisure. For the first time communal dawdling had lost its
      charm for him; not because his fellow dawdlers were less congenial than of
      old, but because in the interval he had known something so immeasurably
      better. He had always felt himself to be the superior of his habitual
      associates, but now the advantage was too great: really, in a sense, it
      was hardly fair to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had flattered himself that Susy would share this feeling; but he
      perceived with annoyance that the arrival of their friends heightened her
      animation. It was as if the inward glow which had given her a new beauty
      were now refracted upon her by the presence of the very people they had
      come to Venice to avoid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lansing was vaguely irritated; and when he asked her how she liked being
      with their old crowd again his irritation was increased by her answering
      with a laugh that she only hoped the poor dears didn&rsquo;t see too plainly how
      they bored her. The patent insincerity of the reply was a shock to
      Lansing. He knew that Susy was not really bored, and he understood that
      she had simply guessed his feelings and instinctively adopted them: that
      henceforth she was always going to think as he thought. To confirm this
      fear he said carelessly: &ldquo;Oh, all the same, it&rsquo;s rather jolly knocking
      about with them again for a bit;&rdquo; and she answered at once, and with equal
      conviction: &ldquo;Yes, isn&rsquo;t it? The old darlings&mdash;all the same!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A fear of the future again laid its cold touch on Lansing. Susy&rsquo;s
      independence and self-sufficiency had been among her chief attractions; if
      she were to turn into an echo their delicious duet ran the risk of
      becoming the dullest of monologues. He forgot that five minutes earlier he
      had resented her being glad to see their friends, and for a moment he
      found himself leaning dizzily over that insoluble riddle of the
      sentimental life: that to be differed with is exasperating, and to be
      agreed with monotonous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more he began to wonder if he were not fundamentally unfitted for the
      married state; and was saved from despair only by remembering that Susy&rsquo;s
      subjection to his moods was not likely to last. But even then it never
      occurred to him to reflect that his apprehensions were superfluous, since
      their tie was avowedly a temporary one. Of the special understanding on
      which their marriage had been based not a trace remained in his thoughts
      of her; the idea that he or she might ever renounce each other for their
      mutual good had long since dwindled to the ghost of an old joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was borne in on him, after a week or two of unbroken sociability, that
      of all his old friends it was the Mortimer Hickses who bored him the
      least. The Hickses had left the Ibis for an apartment in a vast
      dilapidated palace near the Canareggio. They had hired the apartment from
      a painter (one of their newest discoveries), and they put up
      philosophically with the absence of modern conveniences in order to secure
      the inestimable advantage of &ldquo;atmosphere.&rdquo; In this privileged air they
      gathered about them their usual mixed company of quiet studious people and
      noisy exponents of new theories, themselves totally unconscious of the
      disparity between their different guests, and beamingly convinced that at
      last they were seated at the source of wisdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      In old days Lansing would have got half an hour&rsquo;s amusement, followed by a
      long evening of boredom, from the sight of Mrs. Hicks, vast and jewelled,
      seated between a quiet-looking professor of archaeology and a large-browed
      composer, or the high priest of a new dance-step, while Mr. Hicks, beaming
      above his vast white waistcoat, saw to it that the champagne flowed more
      abundantly than the talk, and the bright young secretaries industriously
      &ldquo;kept up&rdquo; with the dizzy cross-current of prophecy and erudition. But a
      change had come over Lansing. Hitherto it was in contrast to his own
      friends that the Hickses had seemed most insufferable; now it was as an
      escape from these same friends that they had become not only sympathetic
      but even interesting. It was something, after all, to be with people who
      did not regard Venice simply as affording exceptional opportunities for
      bathing and adultery, but who were reverently if confusedly aware that
      they were in the presence of something unique and ineffable, and
      determined to make the utmost of their privilege.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; he said to himself one evening, as his eyes wandered, with
      somewhat of a convalescent&rsquo;s simple joy, from one to another of their
      large confiding faces, &ldquo;after all, they&rsquo;ve got a religion....&rdquo; The phrase
      struck him, in the moment of using it, as indicating a new element in his
      own state of mind, and as being, in fact, the key to his new feeling about
      the Hickses. Their muddled ardour for great things was related to his own
      new view of the universe: the people who felt, however dimly, the wonder
      and weight of life must ever after be nearer to him than those to whom it
      was estimated solely by one&rsquo;s balance at the bank. He supposed, on
      reflexion, that that was what he meant when he thought of the Hickses as
      having &ldquo;a religion&rdquo;....
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days later, his well-being was unexpectedly disturbed by the arrival
      of Fred Gillow. Lansing had always felt a tolerant liking for Gillow, a
      large smiling silent young man with an intense and serious desire to miss
      nothing attainable by one of his fortune and standing. What use he made of
      his experiences, Lansing, who had always gone into his own modest
      adventures rather thoroughly, had never been able to guess; but he had
      always suspected the prodigal Fred of being no more than a well-disguised
      looker-on. Now for the first time he began to view him with another eye.
      The Gillows were, in fact, the one uneasy point in Nick&rsquo;s conscience. He
      and Susy from the first, had talked of them less than of any other members
      of their group: they had tacitly avoided the name from the day on which
      Susy had come to Lansing&rsquo;s lodgings to say that Ursula Gillow had asked
      her to renounce him, till that other day, just before their marriage, when
      she had met him with the rapturous cry: &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s our first wedding present!
      Such a thumping big cheque from Fred and Ursula!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Plenty of sympathizing people were ready, Lansing knew, to tell him just
      what had happened in the interval between those two dates; but he had
      taken care not to ask. He had even affected an initiation so complete that
      the friends who burned to enlighten him were discouraged by his so
      obviously knowing more than they; and gradually he had worked himself
      around to their view, and had taken it for granted that he really did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now he perceived that he knew nothing at all, and that the &ldquo;Hullo, old
      Fred!&rdquo; with which Susy hailed Gillow&rsquo;s arrival might be either the usual
      tribal welcome&mdash;since they were all &ldquo;old,&rdquo; and all nicknamed, in
      their private jargon&mdash;or a greeting that concealed inscrutable depths
      of complicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Susy was visibly glad to see Gillow; but she was glad of everything just
      then, and so glad to show her gladness! The fact disarmed her husband and
      made him ashamed of his uneasiness. &ldquo;You ought to have thought this all
      out sooner, or else you ought to chuck thinking of it at all,&rdquo; was the
      sound but ineffectual advice he gave himself on the day after Gillow&rsquo;s
      arrival; and immediately set to work to rethink the whole matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fred Gillow showed no consciousness of disturbing any one&rsquo;s peace of mind.
      Day after day he sprawled for hours on the Lido sands, his arms folded
      under his head, listening to Streffy&rsquo;s nonsense and watching Susy between
      sleepy lids; but he betrayed no desire to see her alone, or to draw her
      into talk apart from the others. More than ever he seemed content to be
      the gratified spectator of a costly show got up for his private
      entertainment. It was not until he heard her, one morning, grumble a
      little at the increasing heat and the menace of mosquitoes, that he said,
      quite as if they had talked the matter over long before, and finally
      settled it: &ldquo;The moor will be ready any time after the first of August.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nick fancied that Susy coloured a little, and drew herself up more
      defiantly than usual as she sent a pebble skimming across the dying
      ripples at their feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be a lot cooler in Scotland,&rdquo; Fred added, with what, for him, was
      an unusual effort at explicitness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, shall we?&rdquo; she retorted gaily; and added with an air of mystery and
      importance, pivoting about on her high heels: &ldquo;Nick&rsquo;s got work to do here.
      It will probably keep us all summer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Work? Rot! You&rsquo;ll die of the smells.&rdquo; Gillow stared perplexedly skyward
      from under his tilted hat-brim; and then brought out, as from the depth of
      a rankling grievance: &ldquo;I thought it was all understood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; Nick asked his wife that night, as they re-entered Ellie&rsquo;s cool
      drawing-room after a late dinner at the Lido, &ldquo;did Gillow think it was
      understood that we were going to his moor in August?&rdquo; He was conscious of
      the oddness of speaking of their friend by his surname, and reddened at
      his blunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Susy had let her lace cloak slide to her feet, and stood before him in the
      faintly-lit room, slim and shimmering-white through black transparencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised her eyebrows carelessly. &ldquo;I told you long ago he&rsquo;d asked us
      there for August.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t tell me you&rsquo;d accepted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled as if he had said something as simple as Fred. &ldquo;I accepted
      everything&mdash;from everybody!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What could he answer? It was the very principle on which their bargain had
      been struck. And if he were to say: &ldquo;Ah, but this is different, because
      I&rsquo;m jealous of Gillow,&rdquo; what light would such an answer shed on his past?
      The time for being jealous&mdash;if so antiquated an attitude were on any ground
      defensible&mdash;would have been before his marriage, and before the acceptance
      of the bounties which had helped to make it possible. He wondered a little
      now that in those days such scruples had not troubled him. His
      inconsistency irritated him, and increased his irritation against Gillow.
      &ldquo;I suppose he thinks he owns us!&rdquo; he grumbled inwardly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had thrown himself into an armchair, and Susy, advancing across the
      shining arabesques of the floor, slid down at his feet, pressed her
      slender length against him, and whispered with lifted face and lips close
      to his: &ldquo;We needn&rsquo;t ever go anywhere you don&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo; For once her
      submission was sweet, and folding her close he whispered back through his
      kiss: &ldquo;Not there, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In her response to his embrace he felt the acquiescence of her whole happy
      self in whatever future he decided on, if only it gave them enough of such
      moments as this; and as they held each other fast in silence his doubts
      and distrust began to seem like a silly injustice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us stay here as long as ever Ellie will let us,&rdquo; he said, as if the
      shadowy walls and shining floors were a magic boundary drawn about his
      happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She murmured her assent and stood up, stretching her sleepy arm above her
      shoulders. &ldquo;How dreadfully late it is.... Will you unhook me?... Oh,
      there&rsquo;s a telegram.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She picked it up from the table, and tearing it open stared a moment at
      the message. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s from Ellie. She&rsquo;s coming to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned to the window and strayed out onto the balcony. Nick followed
      her with enlacing arm. The canal below them lay in moonless shadow, barred
      with a few lingering lights. A last snatch of gondola-music came from far
      off, carried upward on a sultry gust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear old Ellie. All the same... I wish all this belonged to you and me.&rdquo;
       Susy sighed.
    </p>


<h3>VIII.</h3>

    <p>
      <span class="smcap">It</span> was not Mrs. Vanderlyn&rsquo;s fault if, after her arrival, her palace seemed
      to belong any less to the Lansings.
    </p>
    <p>
      She arrived in a mood of such general benevolence that it was impossible
      for Susy, when they finally found themselves alone, to make her view even
      her own recent conduct in any but the most benevolent light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you&rsquo;d be the veriest angel about it all, darling, because I knew
      you&rsquo;d understand me&mdash;especially now,&rdquo; she declared, her slim hands in
      Susy&rsquo;s, her big eyes (so like Clarissa&rsquo;s) resplendent with past pleasures
      and future plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      The expression of her confidence was unexpectedly distasteful to Susy
      Lansing, who had never lent so cold an ear to such warm avowals. She had
      always imagined that being happy one&rsquo;s self made one&mdash;as Mrs.
      Vanderlyn appeared to assume&mdash;more tolerant of the happiness of
      others, of however doubtful elements composed; and she was almost ashamed
      of responding so languidly to her friend&rsquo;s outpourings. But she herself
      had no desire to confide her bliss to Ellie; and why should not Ellie
      observe a similar reticence?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was all so perfect&mdash;you see, dearest, I was meant to be happy,&rdquo;
       that lady continued, as if the possession of so unusual a characteristic
      singled her out for special privileges.
    </p>
    <p>
      Susy, with a certain sharpness, responded that she had always supposed we
      all were.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, dearest: not governesses and mothers-in-law and companions, and
      that sort of people. They wouldn&rsquo;t know how if they tried. But you and I,
      darling&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t consider myself in any way exceptional,&rdquo; Susy intervened. She
      longed to add: &ldquo;Not in your way, at any rate&mdash;&rdquo; but a few minutes
      earlier Mrs. Vanderlyn had told her that the palace was at her disposal
      for the rest of the summer, and that she herself was only going to perch
      there&mdash;if they&rsquo;d let her!&mdash;long enough to gather up her things
      and start for St. Moritz. The memory of this announcement had the effect
      of curbing Susy&rsquo;s irony, and of making her shift the conversation to the
      safer if scarcely less absorbing topic of the number of day and evening
      dresses required for a season at St. Moritz.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she listened to Mrs. Vanderlyn&mdash;no less eloquent on this theme
      than on the other&mdash;Susy began to measure the gulf between her past
      and present. &ldquo;This is the life I used to lead; these are the things I used
      to live for,&rdquo; she thought, as she stood before the outspread glories of
      Mrs. Vanderlyn&rsquo;s wardrobe. Not that she did not still care: she could not
      look at Ellie&rsquo;s laces and silks and furs without picturing herself in
      them, and wondering by what new miracle of management she could give
      herself the air of being dressed by the same consummate artists. But these
      had become minor interests: the past few months had given her a new
      perspective, and the thing that most puzzled and disconcerted her about
      Ellie was the fact that love and finery and bridge and dining-out were
      seemingly all on the same plane to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inspection of the dresses lasted a long time, and was marked by many
      fluctuations of mood on the part of Mrs. Vanderlyn, who passed from
      comparative hopefulness to despair at the total inadequacy of her
      wardrobe. It wouldn&rsquo;t do to go to St. Moritz looking like a frump, and yet
      there was no time to get anything sent from Paris, and, whatever she did,
      she wasn&rsquo;t going to show herself in any dowdy re-arrangements done at
      home. But suddenly light broke on her, and she clasped her hands for joy.
      &ldquo;Why, Nelson&rsquo;ll bring them&mdash;I&rsquo;d forgotten all about Nelson! There&rsquo;ll
      be just time if I wire to him at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Nelson going to join you at St. Moritz?&rdquo; Susy asked, surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens, no! He&rsquo;s coming here to pick up Clarissa and take her to some
      stuffy cure in Austria with his mother. It&rsquo;s too lucky: there&rsquo;s just time
      to telegraph him to bring my things. I didn&rsquo;t mean to wait for him; but it
      won&rsquo;t delay me more than day or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susy&rsquo;s heart sank. She was not much afraid of Ellie alone, but Ellie and
      Nelson together formed an incalculable menace. No one could tell what
      spark of truth might dash from their collision. Susy felt that she could
      deal with the two dangers separately and successively, but not together
      and simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Ellie, why should you wait for Nelson? I&rsquo;m certain to find someone
      here who&rsquo;s going to St. Moritz and will take your things if he brings
      them. It&rsquo;s a pity to risk losing your rooms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This argument appealed for a moment to Mrs. Vanderlyn. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true; they
      say all the hotels are jammed. You dear, you&rsquo;re always so practical!&rdquo; She
      clasped Susy to her scented bosom. &ldquo;And you know, darling, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll
      be glad to get rid of me&mdash;you and Nick! Oh, don&rsquo;t be hypocritical and
      say &lsquo;Nonsense!&rsquo; You see, I understand... I used to think of you so often,
      you two... during those blessed weeks when we two were alone....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sudden tears, brimming over Ellie&rsquo;s lovely eyes, and threatening to
      make the blue circles below them run into the adjoining carmine, filled
      Susy with compunction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor thing&mdash;oh, poor thing!&rdquo; she thought; and hearing herself called
      by Nick, who was waiting to take her out for their usual sunset on the
      lagoon, she felt a wave of pity for the deluded creature who would never
      taste that highest of imaginable joys. &ldquo;But all the same,&rdquo; Susy reflected,
      as she hurried down to her husband, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I persuaded her not to wait
      for Nelson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some days had elapsed since Susy and Nick had had a sunset to themselves,
      and in the interval Susy had once again learned the superior quality of
      the sympathy that held them together. She now viewed all the rest of life
      as no more than a show: a jolly show which it would have been a thousand
      pities to miss, but which, if the need arose, they could get up and leave
      at any moment&mdash;provided that they left it together.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the dusk, while their prow slid over inverted palaces, and through the
      scent of hidden gardens, she leaned against him and murmured, her mind
      returning to the recent scene with Ellie: &ldquo;Nick, should you hate me
      dreadfully if I had no clothes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her husband was kindling a cigarette, and the match lit up the grin with
      which he answered: &ldquo;But, my dear, have I ever shown the slightest symptom&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, rubbish! When a woman says: &lsquo;No clothes,&rsquo; she means: &lsquo;Not the right
      clothes.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took a meditative puff. &ldquo;Ah, you&rsquo;ve been going over Ellie&rsquo;s finery with
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes: all those trunks and trunks full. And she finds she&rsquo;s got nothing
      for St. Moritz!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he murmured, drowsy with content, and manifesting but a
      languid interest in the subject of Mrs. Vanderlyn&rsquo;s wardrobe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only fancy&mdash;she very nearly decided to stop over for Nelson&rsquo;s
      arrival next week, so that he might bring her two or three more trunkfuls
      from Paris. But mercifully I&rsquo;ve managed to persuade her that it would be
      foolish to wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susy felt a hardly perceptible shifting of her husband&rsquo;s lounging body,
      and was aware, through all her watchful tentacles, of a widening of his
      half-closed lids.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You &lsquo;managed&rsquo;&mdash;?&rdquo; She fancied he paused on the word ironically. &ldquo;But
      why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why on earth should you try to prevent Ellie&rsquo;s waiting for Nelson, if for
      once in her life she wants to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susy, conscious of reddening suddenly, drew back as though the leap of her
      tell-tale heart might have penetrated the blue flannel shoulder against
      which she leaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, dearest&mdash;!&rdquo; she murmured; but with a sudden doggedness he
      renewed his &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because she&rsquo;s in such a fever to get to St. Moritz&mdash;and in such a
      funk lest the hotel shouldn&rsquo;t keep her rooms,&rdquo; Susy somewhat breathlessly
      produced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah&mdash;I see.&rdquo; Nick paused again. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a devoted friend, aren&rsquo;t
      you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an odd question! There&rsquo;s hardly anyone I&rsquo;ve reason to be more
      devoted to than Ellie,&rdquo; his wife answered; and she felt his contrite clasp
      on her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darling! No; nor I&mdash;. Or more grateful to for leaving us alone in
      this heaven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dimness had fallen on the waters, and her lifted lips met his bending
      ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trailing late into dinner that evening, Ellie announced that, after all,
      she had decided it was safest to wait for Nelson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should simply worry myself ill if I weren&rsquo;t sure of getting my things,&rdquo;
       she said, in the tone of tender solicitude with which she always discussed
      her own difficulties. &ldquo;After all, people who deny themselves everything do
      get warped and bitter, don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; she argued plaintively, her lovely
      eyes wandering from one to the other of her assembled friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strefford remarked gravely that it was the complaint which had fatally
      undermined his own health; and in the laugh that followed the party
      drifted into the great vaulted dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mind your laughing at me, Streffy darling,&rdquo; his hostess
      retorted, pressing his arm against her own; and Susy, receiving the shock
      of their rapidly exchanged glance, said to herself, with a sharp twinge of
      apprehension: &ldquo;Of course Streffy knows everything; he showed no surprise
      at finding Ellie away when he arrived. And if he knows, what&rsquo;s to prevent
      Nelson&rsquo;s finding out?&rdquo; For Strefford, in a mood of mischief, was no more
      to be trusted than a malicious child.
    </p>
    <p>
      Susy instantly resolved to risk speaking to him, if need be even betraying
      to him the secret of the letters. Only by revealing the depth of her own
      danger could she hope to secure his silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the balcony, late in the evening, while the others were listening
      indoors to the low modulations of a young composer who had embroidered his
      fancies on Browning&rsquo;s &ldquo;Toccata,&rdquo; Susy found her chance. Strefford,
      unsummoned, had followed her out, and stood silently smoking at her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, Streff&mdash;oh, why should you and I make mysteries to each
      other?&rdquo; she suddenly began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, indeed: but do we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susy glanced back at the group around the piano. &ldquo;About Ellie, I mean&mdash;and
      Nelson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord! Ellie and Nelson? You call that a mystery? I should as soon apply
      the term to one of the million candle-power advertisements that adorn your
      native thoroughfares.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes. But&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped again. Had she not tacitly promised
      Ellie not to speak?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Susan, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Strefford asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I do, then: you&rsquo;re afraid that, if Ellie and Nelson meet here,
      she&rsquo;ll blurt out something&mdash;injudicious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Susy cried with conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then&mdash;who will! I trust that superhuman child not to. And you
      and I and Nick&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she gasped, interrupting him, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s just it. Nick doesn&rsquo;t know...
      doesn&rsquo;t even suspect. And if he did....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Strefford flung away his cigar and turned to scrutinize her. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see&mdash;hanged
      if I do. What business is it of any of us, after all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That, of course, was the old view that cloaked connivance in an air of
      decency. But to Susy it no longer carried conviction, and she hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Nick should find out that I know....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t he know that you know? After all, I suppose it&rsquo;s
      not the first time&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She remained silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first time you&rsquo;ve received confidences&mdash;from married friends.
      Does Nick suppose you&rsquo;ve lived even to your tender age without... Hang it,
      what&rsquo;s come over you, child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What had, indeed, that she could make clear to him? And yet more than ever
      she felt the need of having him securely on her side. Once his word was
      pledged, he was safe: otherwise there was no limit to his capacity for
      wilful harmfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Streff, you and I know that Ellie hasn&rsquo;t been away for a cure;
      and that if poor Clarissa was sworn to secrecy it was not because it
      &lsquo;worries father&rsquo; to think that mother needs to take care of her health.&rdquo;
       She paused, hating herself for the ironic note she had tried to sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;?&rdquo; he questioned, from the depths of the chair into which he
      had sunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Nick doesn&rsquo;t... doesn&rsquo;t dream of it. If he knew that we owed our
      summer here to... to my knowing....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Strefford sat silent: she felt his astonished stare through the darkness.
      &ldquo;Jove!&rdquo; he said at last, with a low whistle Susy bent over the balustrade,
      her heart thumping against the stone rail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was left of soul, I wonder&mdash;?&rdquo; the young composer&rsquo;s voice
      shrilled through the open windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strefford sank into another silence, from which he roused himself only as
      Susy turned back toward the lighted threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear, we&rsquo;ll see it through between us; you and I&mdash;and Clarissa,&rdquo;
       he said with his rasping laugh, rising to follow her. He caught her hand
      and gave it a short pressure as they re-entered the drawing-room, where
      Ellie was saying plaintively to Fred Gillow: &ldquo;I can never hear that thing
      sung without wanting to cry like a baby.&rdquo;
     </p>


<h3>IX.</h3>

    <p>
      <span class="smcap">Nelson Vanderlyn</span>, still in his travelling clothes, paused on the threshold
      of his own dining-room and surveyed the scene with pardonable
      satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a short round man, with a grizzled head, small facetious eyes and a
      large and credulous smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the luncheon table sat his wife, between Charlie Strefford and Nick
      Lansing. Next to Strefford, perched on her high chair, Clarissa throned in
      infant beauty, while Susy Lansing cut up a peach for her. Through wide
      orange awnings the sun slanted in upon the white-clad group.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;well&mdash;well! So I&rsquo;ve caught you at it!&rdquo; cried the happy
      father, whose inveterate habit it was to address his wife and friends as
      if he had surprised them at an inopportune moment. Stealing up from
      behind, he lifted his daughter into the air, while a chorus of &ldquo;Hello, old
      Nelson,&rdquo; hailed his appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was two or three years since Nick Lansing had seen Mr. Vanderlyn, who
      was now the London representative of the big New York bank of Vanderlyn
      &amp; Co., and had exchanged his sumptuous house in Fifth Avenue for
      another, more sumptuous still, in Mayfair; and the young man looked
      curiously and attentively at his host.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Vanderlyn had grown older and stouter, but his face still kept its
      look of somewhat worn optimism. He embraced his wife, greeted Susy
      affectionately, and distributed cordial hand-grasps to the two men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo,&rdquo; he exclaimed, suddenly noticing a pearl and coral trinket hanging
      from Clarissa&rsquo;s neck. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s been giving my daughter jewellery, I&rsquo;d like
      to know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Streffy did&mdash;just think, father! Because I said I&rsquo;d rather have
      it than a book, you know,&rdquo; Clarissa lucidly explained, her arms tight
      about her father&rsquo;s neck, her beaming eyes on Strefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nelson Vanderlyn&rsquo;s own eyes took on the look of shrewdness which came into
      them whenever there was a question of material values.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, Streffy? Caught you at it, eh? Upon my soul-spoiling the brat like
      that! You&rsquo;d no business to, my dear chap-a lovely baroque pearl&mdash;&rdquo; he
      protested, with the half-apologetic tone of the rich man embarrassed by
      too costly a gift from an impecunious friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, hadn&rsquo;t I? Why? Because it&rsquo;s too good for Clarissa, or too expensive
      for me? Of course you daren&rsquo;t imply the first; and as for me&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
      had a windfall, and am blowing it in on the ladies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Strefford, Lansing had noticed, always used American slang when he was
      slightly at a loss, and wished to divert attention from the main point.
      But why was he embarrassed, whose attention did he wish to divert, It was
      plain that Vanderlyn&rsquo;s protest had been merely formal: like most of the
      wealthy, he had only the dimmest notion of what money represented to the
      poor. But it was unusual for Strefford to give any one a present, and
      especially an expensive one: perhaps that was what had fixed Vanderlyn&rsquo;s
      attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A windfall?&rdquo; he gaily repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, a tiny one: I was offered a thumping rent for my little place at
      Como, and dashed over here to squander my millions with the rest of you,&rdquo;
       said Strefford imperturbably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vanderlyn&rsquo;s look immediately became interested and sympathetic. &ldquo;What&mdash;the
      scene of the honey-moon?&rdquo; He included Nick and Susy in his friendly smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so: the reward of virtue. I say, give me a cigar, will you, old man,
      I left some awfully good ones at Como, worse luck&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t mind
      telling you that Ellie&rsquo;s no judge of tobacco, and that Nick&rsquo;s too far gone
      in bliss to care what he smokes,&rdquo; Strefford grumbled, stretching a hand
      toward his host&rsquo;s cigar-case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do like jewellery best,&rdquo; Clarissa murmured, hugging her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nelson Vanderlyn&rsquo;s first word to his wife had been that he had brought her
      all her toggery; and she had welcomed him with appropriate enthusiasm. In
      fact, to the lookers-on her joy at seeing him seemed rather too patently
      in proportion to her satisfaction at getting her clothes. But no such
      suspicion appeared to mar Mr. Vanderlyn&rsquo;s happiness in being, for once,
      and for nearly twenty-four hours, under the same roof with his wife and
      child. He did not conceal his regret at having promised his mother to join
      her the next day; and added, with a wistful glance at Ellie: &ldquo;If only I&rsquo;d
      known you meant to wait for me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But being a man of duty, in domestic as well as business affairs, he did
      not even consider the possibility of disappointing the exacting old lady
      to whom he owed his being. &ldquo;Mother cares for so few people,&rdquo; he used to
      say, not without a touch of filial pride in the parental exclusiveness,
      &ldquo;that I have to be with her rather more than if she were more sociable&rdquo;;
      and with smiling resignation he gave orders that Clarissa should be ready
      to start the next evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And meanwhile,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll have all the good time that&rsquo;s
      going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ladies of the party seemed united in the desire to further this
      resolve; and it was settled that as soon as Mr. Vanderlyn had despatched a
      hasty luncheon, his wife, Clarissa and Susy should carry him off for a
      tea-picnic at Torcello. They did not even suggest that Strefford or Nick
      should be of the party, or that any of the other young men of the group
      should be summoned; as Susy said, Nelson wanted to go off alone with his
      harem. And Lansing and Strefford were left to watch the departure of the
      happy Pasha ensconced between attentive beauties.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;that&rsquo;s what you call being married!&rdquo; Strefford commented,
      waving his battered Panama at Clarissa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Lansing laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does. But do you know&mdash;&rdquo; Strefford paused and swung about on his
      companion&mdash;&ldquo;do you know, when the Rude Awakening comes, I don&rsquo;t care
      to be there. I believe there&rsquo;ll be some crockery broken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t wonder,&rdquo; Lansing answered indifferently. He wandered away to
      his own room, leaving Strefford to philosophize to his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lansing had always known about poor old Nelson: who hadn&rsquo;t, except poor
      old Nelson? The case had once seemed amusing because so typical; now, it
      rather irritated Nick that Vanderlyn should be so complete an ass. But he
      would be off the next day, and so would Ellie, and then, for many
      enchanted weeks, the palace would once more be the property of Nick and
      Susy. Of all the people who came and went in it, they were the only ones
      who appreciated it, or knew how it was meant to be lived in; and that made
      it theirs in the only valid sense. In this light it became easy to regard
      the Vanderlyns as mere transient intruders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having relegated them to this convenient distance, Lansing shut himself up
      with his book. He had returned to it with fresh energy after his few weeks
      of holiday-making, and was determined to finish it quickly. He did not
      expect that it would bring in much money; but if it were moderately
      successful it might give him an opening in the reviews and magazines, and
      in that case he meant to abandon archaeology for novels, since it was only
      as a purveyor of fiction that he could count on earning a living for
      himself and Susy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late in the afternoon he laid down his pen and wandered out of doors. He
      loved the increasing heat of the Venetian summer, the bruised peach-tints
      of worn house-fronts, the enamelling of sunlight on dark green canals, the
      smell of half-decayed fruits and flowers thickening the languid air. What
      visions he could build, if he dared, of being tucked away with Susy in the
      attic of some tumble-down palace, above a jade-green waterway, with a
      terrace overhanging a scrap of neglected garden&mdash;and cheques from the
      publishers dropping in at convenient intervals! Why should they not settle
      in Venice if he pulled it off!
    </p>
    <p>
      He found himself before the church of the Scalzi, and pushing open the
      leathern door wandered up the nave under the whirl of rose-and-lemon
      angels in Tiepolo&rsquo;s great vault. It was not a church in which one was
      likely to run across sight-seers; but he presently remarked a young lady
      standing alone near the choir, and assiduously applying her field-glass to
      the celestial vortex, from which she occasionally glanced down at an open
      manual.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Lansing&rsquo;s step sounded on the pavement, the young lady, turning,
      revealed herself as Miss Hicks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah&mdash;you like this too? It&rsquo;s several centuries out of your line,
      though, isn&rsquo;t it!&rdquo; Nick asked as they shook hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gazed at him gravely. &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t one like things that are out of
      one&rsquo;s line?&rdquo; she answered; and he agreed, with a laugh, that it was often
      an incentive.
    </p>
    <p>
      She continued to fix her grave eyes on him, and after one or two remarks
      about the Tiepolos he perceived that she was feeling her way toward a
      subject of more personal interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to see you alone,&rdquo; she said at length, with an abruptness that
      might have seemed awkward had it not been so completely unconscious. She
      turned toward a cluster of straw chairs, and signed to Nick to seat
      himself beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I seldom do,&rdquo; she added, with the serious smile that made her heavy face
      almost handsome; and she went on, giving him no time to protest: &ldquo;I wanted
      to speak to you&mdash;to explain about father&rsquo;s invitation to go with us
      to Persia and Turkestan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To explain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. You found the letter when you arrived here just after your marriage,
      didn&rsquo;t you? You must have thought it odd, our asking you just then; but we
      hadn&rsquo;t heard that you were married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I guessed as much: it happened very quietly, and I was remiss about
      announcing it, even to old friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lansing frowned. His thoughts had wandered away to the evening when he had
      found Mrs. Hicks&rsquo;s letter in the mail awaiting him at Venice. The day was
      associated in his mind with the ridiculous and mortifying episode of the
      cigars&mdash;the expensive cigars that Susy had wanted to carry away from
      Strefford&rsquo;s villa. Their brief exchange of views on the subject had left
      the first blur on the perfect surface of his happiness, and he still felt
      an uncomfortable heat at the remembrance. For a few hours the prospect of
      life with Susy had seemed unendurable; and it was just at that moment that
      he had found the letter from Mrs. Hicks, with its almost irresistible
      invitation. If only her daughter had known how nearly he had accepted it!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a dreadful temptation,&rdquo; he said, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To go with us? Then why&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, everything&rsquo;s different now: I&rsquo;ve got to stick to my writing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Hicks still bent on him the same unblinking scrutiny. &ldquo;Does that mean
      that you&rsquo;re going to give up your real work?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My real work&mdash;archaeology?&rdquo; He smiled again to hide a twitch of
      regret. &ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;m afraid it hardly produces a living wage; and I&rsquo;ve got to
      think of that.&rdquo; He coloured suddenly, as if suspecting that Miss Hicks
      might consider the avowal an opening for he hardly knew what ponderous
      offer of aid. The Hicks munificence was too uncalculating not to be
      occasionally oppressive. But looking at her again he saw that her eyes
      were full of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it was your vocation,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So did I. But life comes along, and upsets things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I understand. There may be things&mdash;worth giving up all other
      things for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are!&rdquo; cried Nick with beaming emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was conscious that Miss Hicks&rsquo;s eyes demanded of him even more than
      this sweeping affirmation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your novel may fail,&rdquo; she said with her odd harshness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may&mdash;it probably will,&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;But if one stopped to
      consider such possibilities&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you have to, with a wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear Coral&mdash;how old are you? Not twenty?&rdquo; he questioned,
      laying a brotherly hand on hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stared at him a moment, and sprang up clumsily from her chair. &ldquo;I was
      never young... if that&rsquo;s what you mean. It&rsquo;s lucky, isn&rsquo;t it, that my
      parents gave me such a grand education? Because, you see, art&rsquo;s a
      wonderful resource.&rdquo; (She pronounced it RE-source.)
    </p>
    <p>
      He continued to look at her kindly. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t need it&mdash;or any other&mdash;when
      you grow young, as you will some day,&rdquo; he assured her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean, when I fall in love? But I am in love&mdash;Oh, there&rsquo;s
      Eldorada and Mr. Beck!&rdquo; She broke off with a jerk, signalling with her
      field-glass to the pair who had just appeared at the farther end of the
      nave. &ldquo;I told them that if they&rsquo;d meet me here to-day I&rsquo;d try to make them
      understand Tiepolo. Because, you see, at home we never really have
      understood Tiepolo; and Mr. Beck and Eldorada are the only ones to realize
      it. Mr. Buttles simply won&rsquo;t.&rdquo; She turned to Lansing and held out her
      hand. &ldquo;I am in love,&rdquo; she repeated earnestly, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s the reason why I
      find art such a RE source.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She restored her eye-glasses, opened her manual, and strode across the
      church to the expectant neophytes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lansing, looking after her, wondered for half a moment whether Mr. Beck
      were the object of this apparently unrequited sentiment; then, with a
      queer start of introspection, abruptly decided that, no, he certainly was
      not. But then&mdash;but then&mdash;. Well, there was no use in following
      up such conjectures.... He turned home-ward, wondering if the picnickers
      had already reached Palazzo Vanderlyn.
    </p>
    <p>
      They got back only in time for a late dinner, full of chaff and laughter,
      and apparently still enchanted with each other&rsquo;s society. Nelson Vanderlyn
      beamed on his wife, sent his daughter off to bed with a kiss, and leaning
      back in his armchair before the fruit-and-flower-laden table, declared
      that he&rsquo;d never spent a jollier day in his life. Susy seemed to come in
      for a full share of his approbation, and Lansing thought that Ellie was
      unusually demonstrative to her friend. Strefford, from his hostess&rsquo;s side,
      glanced across now and then at young Mrs. Lansing, and his glance seemed
      to Lansing a confidential comment on the Vanderlyn raptures. But then
      Strefford was always having private jokes with people or about them; and
      Lansing was irritated with himself for perpetually suspecting his best
      friends of vague complicities at his expense. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m going to be jealous
      of Streffy now&mdash;!&rdquo; he concluded with a grimace of self-derision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly Susy looked lovely enough to justify the most irrational pangs.
      As a girl she had been, for some people&rsquo;s taste, a trifle fine-drawn and
      sharp-edged; now, to her old lightness of line was added a shadowy bloom,
      a sort of star-reflecting depth. Her movements were slower, less angular;
      her mouth had a needing droop, her lids seemed weighed down by their
      lashes; and then suddenly the old spirit would reveal itself through the
      new languor, like the tartness at the core of a sweet fruit. As her
      husband looked at her across the flowers and lights he laughed inwardly at
      the nothingness of all things else.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vanderlyn and Clarissa left betimes the next morning; and Mrs. Vanderlyn,
      who was to start for St. Moritz in the afternoon, devoted her last hours
      to anxious conferences with her maid and Susy. Strefford, with Fred Gillow
      and the others, had gone for a swim at the Lido, and Lansing seized the
      opportunity to get back to his book.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quietness of the great echoing place gave him a foretaste of the
      solitude to come. By mid-August all their party would be scattered: the
      Hickses off on a cruise to Crete and the Ægean, Fred Gillow on the way to
      his moor, Strefford to stay with friends in Capri till his annual visit to
      Northumberland in September. One by one the others would follow, and
      Lansing and Susy be left alone in the great sun-proof palace, alone under
      the star-laden skies, alone with the great orange moons&mdash;still theirs!&mdash;above
      the bell-tower of San Giorgio. The novel, in that blessed quiet, would
      unfold itself as harmoniously as his dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wrote on, forgetful of the passing hours, till the door opened and he
      heard a step behind him. The next moment two hands were clasped over his
      eyes, and the air was full of Mrs. Vanderlyn&rsquo;s last new scent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You dear thing&mdash;I&rsquo;m just off, you know,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Susy told me you
      were working, and I forbade her to call you down. She and Streffy are
      waiting to take me to the station, and I&rsquo;ve run up to say good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ellie, dear!&rdquo; Full of compunction, Lansing pushed aside his writing and
      started up; but she pressed him back into his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! I should never forgive myself if I&rsquo;d interrupted you. I oughtn&rsquo;t
      to have come up; Susy didn&rsquo;t want me to. But I had to tell you, you
      dear.... I had to thank you...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In her dark travelling dress and hat, so discreetly conspicuous, so
      negligent and so studied, with a veil masking her paint, and gloves hiding
      her rings, she looked younger, simpler, more natural than he had ever seen
      her. Poor Ellie such a good fellow, after all!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To thank me? For what? For being so happy here?&rdquo; he laughed, taking her
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him, laughed back, and flung her arms about his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For helping me to be so happy elsewhere&mdash;you and Susy, you two
      blessed darlings!&rdquo; she cried, with a kiss on his cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their eyes met for a second; then her arms slipped slowly downward,
      dropping to her sides. Lansing sat before her like a stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she gasped, &ldquo;why do you stare so? Didn&rsquo;t you know...?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They heard Strefford&rsquo;s shrill voice on the stairs. &ldquo;Ellie, where the deuce
      are you? Susy&rsquo;s in the gondola. You&rsquo;ll miss the train!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lansing stood up and caught Mrs. Vanderlyn by the wrist. &ldquo;What do you
      mean? What are you talking about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothing... But you were both such bricks about the letters.... And
      when Nelson was here, too.... Nick, don&rsquo;t hurt my wrist so! I must run!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He dropped her hand and stood motionless, staring after her and listening
      to the click of her high heels as she fled across the room and along the
      echoing corridor.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he turned back to the table he noticed that a small morocco case had
      fallen among his papers. In falling it had opened, and before him, on the
      pale velvet lining, lay a scarf-pin set with a perfect pearl. He picked
      the box up, and was about to hasten after Mrs. Vanderlyn&mdash;it was so
      like her to shed jewels on her path!&mdash;when he noticed his own
      initials on the cover.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dropped the box as if it had been a hot coal, and sat for a long while
      gazing at the gold N. L., which seemed to have burnt itself into his
      flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he roused himself and stood up.
    </p>


<h3>X.</h3>

    <p>
      <span class="smcap">With</span> a sigh of relief Susy drew the pins from her hat and threw herself
      down on the lounge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ordeal she had dreaded was over, and Mr. and Mrs. Vanderlyn had safely
      gone their several ways. Poor Ellie was not noted for prudence, and when
      life smiled on her she was given to betraying her gratitude too openly;
      but thanks to Susy&rsquo;s vigilance (and, no doubt, to Strefford&rsquo;s tacit
      co-operation), the dreaded twenty-four hours were happily over. Nelson
      Vanderlyn had departed without a shadow on his brow, and though Ellie&rsquo;s,
      when she came down from bidding Nick good-bye, had seemed to Susy less
      serene than usual, she became her normal self as soon as it was discovered
      that the red morocco bag with her jewel-box was missing. Before it had
      been discovered in the depths of the gondola they had reached the station,
      and there was just time to thrust her into her &ldquo;sleeper,&rdquo; from which she
      was seen to wave an unperturbed farewell to her friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear, we&rsquo;ve been it through,&rdquo; Strefford remarked with a deep
      breath as the St. Moritz express rolled away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Susy sighed in mute complicity; then, as if to cover her
      self-betrayal: &ldquo;Poor darling, she does so like what she likes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;even if it&rsquo;s a rotten bounder,&rdquo; Strefford agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A rotten bounder? Why, I thought&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That it was still young Davenant? Lord, no&mdash;not for the last six
      months. Didn&rsquo;t she tell you&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susy felt herself redden. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t ask her&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask her? You mean you didn&rsquo;t let her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t let her. And I don&rsquo;t let you,&rdquo; Susy added sharply, as he helped
      her into the gondola.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, all right: I daresay you&rsquo;re right. It simplifies things,&rdquo; Strefford
      placidly acquiesced.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made no answer, and in silence they glided homeward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, in the quiet of her own room, Susy lay and pondered on the distance
      she had travelled during the last year. Strefford had read her mind with
      his usual penetration. It was true that there had been a time when she
      would have thought it perfectly natural that Ellie should tell her
      everything; that the name of young Davenant&rsquo;s successor should be confided
      to her as a matter of course. Apparently even Ellie had been obscurely
      aware of the change, for after a first attempt to force her confidences on
      Susy she had contented herself with vague expressions of gratitude,
      allusive smiles and sighs, and the pretty &ldquo;surprise&rdquo; of the sapphire
      bangle slipped onto her friend&rsquo;s wrist in the act of their farewell
      embrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bangle was extremely handsome. Susy, who had an auctioneer&rsquo;s eye for
      values, knew to a fraction the worth of those deep convex stones
      alternating with small emeralds and brilliants. She was glad to own the
      bracelet, and enchanted with the effect it produced on her slim wrist;
      yet, even while admiring it, and rejoicing that it was hers, she had
      already transmuted it into specie, and reckoned just how far it would go
      toward the paying of domestic necessities. For whatever came to her now
      interested her only as something more to be offered up to Nick.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened and Nick came in. Dusk had fallen, and she could not see
      his face; but something in the jerk of the door-handle roused her
      ever-wakeful apprehension. She hurried toward him with outstretched wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look, dearest&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t it too darling of Ellie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pressed the button of the lamp that lit her dressing-table, and her
      husband&rsquo;s face started unfamiliarly out of the twilight. She slipped off
      the bracelet and held it up to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I can go you one better,&rdquo; he said with a laugh; and pulling a morocco
      case from his pocket he flung it down among the scent-bottles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Susy opened the case automatically, staring at the pearl because she was
      afraid to look again at Nick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ellie&mdash;gave you this?&rdquo; she asked at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. She gave me this.&rdquo; There was a pause. &ldquo;Would you mind telling me,&rdquo;
       Lansing continued in the same dead-level tone, &ldquo;exactly for what services
      we&rsquo;ve both been so handsomely paid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pearl is beautiful,&rdquo; Susy murmured, to gain time, while her head spun
      round with unimaginable terrors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So are your sapphires; though, on closer examination, my services would
      appear to have been valued rather higher than yours. Would you be kind
      enough to tell me just what they were?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susy threw her head back and looked at him. &ldquo;What on earth are you talking
      about, Nick! Why shouldn&rsquo;t Ellie have given us these things? Do you forget
      that it&rsquo;s like our giving her a pen-wiper or a button-hook? What is it you
      are trying to suggest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It had cost her a considerable effort to hold his eyes while she put the
      questions. Something had happened between him and Ellie, that was
      evident&mdash;one of those hideous unforeseeable blunders that may cause one&rsquo;s
      cleverest plans to crumble at a stroke; and again Susy shuddered at the
      frailty of her bliss. But her old training stood her in good stead. There
      had been more than one moment in her past when everything&mdash;somebody else&rsquo;s
      everything&mdash;had depended on her keeping a cool head and a clear glance. It
      would have been a wonder if now, when she felt her own everything at
      stake, she had not been able to put up as good a defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she repeated impatiently, as Lansing continued to remain
      silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m here to ask,&rdquo; he returned, keeping his eyes as steady as
      she kept hers. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no reason on earth, as you say, why Ellie
      shouldn&rsquo;t give us presents&mdash;as expensive presents as she likes; and
      the pearl is a beauty. All I ask is: for what specific services were they
      given? For, allowing for all the absence of scruple that marks the
      intercourse of truly civilized people, you&rsquo;ll probably agree that there
      are limits; at least up to now there have been limits....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know what you mean. I suppose Ellie wanted to show that
      she was grateful to us for looking after Clarissa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she gave us all this in exchange for that, didn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; he suggested,
      with a sweep of the hand around the beautiful shadowy room. &ldquo;A whole
      summer of it if we choose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susy smiled. &ldquo;Apparently she didn&rsquo;t think that enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a doting mother! It shows the store she sets upon her child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t you set store upon Clarissa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clarissa is exquisite; but her mother didn&rsquo;t mention her in offering me
      this recompense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susy lifted her head again. &ldquo;Whom did she mention?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vanderlyn,&rdquo; said Lansing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vanderlyn? Nelson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;and some letters... something about letters.... What is it, my
      dear, that you and I have been hired to hide from Vanderlyn? Because I
      should like to know,&rdquo; Nick broke out savagely, &ldquo;if we&rsquo;ve been adequately
      paid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susy was silent: she needed time to reckon up her forces, and study her
      next move; and her brain was in such a whirl of fear that she could at
      last only retort: &ldquo;What is it that Ellie said to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lansing laughed again. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what you&rsquo;d like to find out&mdash;isn&rsquo;t
      it?&mdash;in order to know the line to take in making your explanation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sneer had an effect that he could not have foreseen, and that Susy
      herself had not expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t let us speak to each other like that!&rdquo; she cried;
      and sinking down by the dressing-table she hid her face in her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to her, now, that nothing mattered except that their love for
      each other, their faith in each other, should be saved from some
      unhealable hurt. She was willing to tell Nick everything&mdash;she wanted
      to tell him everything&mdash;if only she could be sure of reaching a
      responsive chord in him. But the scene of the cigars came back to her, and
      benumbed her. If only she could make him see that nothing was of any
      account as long as they continued to love each other!
    </p>
    <p>
      His touch fell compassionately on her shoulder. &ldquo;Poor child&mdash;don&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
       he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their eyes met, but his expression checked the smile breaking through her
      tears. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;that we&rsquo;ve got to have this thing
      out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She continued to stare at him through a prism of tears. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t&mdash;while
      you stand up like that,&rdquo; she stammered, childishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had cowered down again into a corner of the lounge; but Lansing did
      not seat himself at her side. He took a chair facing her, like a caller on
      the farther side of a stately tea-tray. &ldquo;Will that do?&rdquo; he asked with a
      stiff smile, as if to humour her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing will do&mdash;as long as you&rsquo;re not you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head wearily. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use? You accept things
      theoretically&mdash;and then when they happen....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What things? What has happened!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sudden impatience mastered her. What did he suppose, after all&mdash;?
      &ldquo;But you know all about Ellie. We used to talk about her often enough in
      old times,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ellie and young Davenant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young Davenant; or the others....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or the others. But what business was it of ours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s just what I think!&rdquo; she cried, springing up with an explosion
      of relief. Lansing stood up also, but there was no answering light in his
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re outside of all that; we&rsquo;ve nothing to do with it, have we?&rdquo; he
      pursued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing whatever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what on earth is the meaning of Ellie&rsquo;s gratitude? Gratitude for
      what we&rsquo;ve done about some letters&mdash;and about Vanderlyn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not you,&rdquo; Susy cried, involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I? Then you?&rdquo; He came close and took her by the wrist. &ldquo;Answer me.
      Have you been mixed up in some dirty business of Ellie&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause. She found it impossible to speak, with that burning
      grasp on the wrist where the bangle had been. At length he let her go and
      moved away. &ldquo;Answer,&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you it was my business and not yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He received this in silence; then he questioned: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been sending
      letters for her, I suppose? To whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, why do you torment me? Nelson was not supposed to know that she&rsquo;d
      been away. She left me the letters to post to him once a week. I found
      them here the night we arrived.... It was the price&mdash;for this. Oh,
      Nick, say it&rsquo;s been worth it&mdash;say at least that it&rsquo;s been worth it!&rdquo; she
      implored him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood motionless, unresponding. One hand drummed on the corner of her
      dressing-table, making the jewelled bangle dance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many letters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know... four... five... What does it matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And once a week, for six weeks&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you took it all as a matter of course?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No: I hated it. But what could I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What could you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When our being together depended on it? Oh, Nick, how could you think I&rsquo;d
      give you up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me up?&rdquo; he echoed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t our being together depend on&mdash;on what we can get
      out of people? And hasn&rsquo;t there always got to be some give-and-take? Did
      you ever in your life get anything for nothing?&rdquo; she cried with sudden
      exasperation. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve lived among these people as long as I have; I
      suppose it&rsquo;s not the first time&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By God, but it is,&rdquo; he exclaimed, flushing. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s the difference&mdash;the
      fundamental difference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The difference!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Between you and me. I&rsquo;ve never in my life done people&rsquo;s dirty work for
      them&mdash;least of all for favours in return. I suppose you guessed it,
      or you wouldn&rsquo;t have hidden this beastly business from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The blood rose to Susy&rsquo;s temples also. Yes, she had guessed it;
      instinctively, from the day she had first visited him in his bare
      lodgings, she had been aware of his stricter standard. But how could she
      tell him that under his influence her standard had become stricter too,
      and that it was as much to hide her humiliation from herself as to escape
      his anger that she had held her tongue?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You knew I wouldn&rsquo;t have stayed here another day if I&rsquo;d known,&rdquo; he
      continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes: and then where in the world should we have gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that&mdash;in one way or another&mdash;what you call
      give-and-take is the price of our remaining together?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it,&rdquo; she faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we&rsquo;d better part, hadn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke in a low tone, thoughtfully and deliberately, as if this had been
      the inevitable conclusion to which their passionate argument had led.
    </p>
    <p>
      Susy made no answer. For a moment she ceased to be conscious of the causes
      of what had happened; the thing itself seemed to have smothered her under
      its ruins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nick wandered away from the dressing-table and stood gazing out of the
      window at the darkening canal flecked with lights. She looked at his back,
      and wondered what would happen if she were to go up to him and fling her
      arms about him. But even if her touch could have broken the spell, she was
      not sure she would have chosen that way of breaking it. Beneath her
      speechless anguish there burned the half-conscious sense of having been
      unfairly treated. When they had entered into their queer compact, Nick had
      known as well as she on what compromises and concessions the life they
      were to live together must be based. That he should have forgotten it
      seemed so unbelievable that she wondered, with a new leap of fear, if he
      were using the wretched Ellie&rsquo;s indiscretion as a means of escape from a
      tie already wearied of. Suddenly she raised her head with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all&mdash;you were right when you wanted me to be your mistress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned on her with an astonished stare. &ldquo;You&mdash;my mistress?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Through all her pain she thrilled with pride at the discovery that such a
      possibility had long since become unthinkable to him. But she insisted.
      &ldquo;That day at the Fulmers&rsquo;&mdash;have you forgotten? When you said it would
      be sheer madness for us to marry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lansing stood leaning in the embrasure of the window, his eyes fixed on
      the mosaic volutes of the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was right enough when I said it would be sheer madness for us to
      marry,&rdquo; he rejoined at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sprang up trembling. &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s easily settled. Our compact&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that compact&mdash;&rdquo; he interrupted her with an impatient laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you asking me to carry it out now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I said we&rsquo;d better part?&rdquo; He paused. &ldquo;But the compact&mdash;I&rsquo;d
      almost forgotten it&mdash;was to the effect, wasn&rsquo;t it, that we were to
      give each other a helping hand if either of us had a better chance? The
      thing was absurd, of course; a mere joke; from my point of view, at least.
      I shall never want any better chance... any other chance....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Nick, oh, Nick... but then....&rdquo; She was close to him, his face
      looming down through her tears; but he put her back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would have been easy enough, wouldn&rsquo;t it,&rdquo; he rejoined, &ldquo;if we&rsquo;d been
      as detachable as all that? As it is, it&rsquo;s going to hurt horribly. But
      talking it over won&rsquo;t help. You were right just now when you asked how
      else we were going to live. We&rsquo;re born parasites, both, I suppose, or we&rsquo;d
      have found out some way long ago. But I find there are things I might put
      up with for myself, at a pinch&mdash;and should, probably, in time that I
      can&rsquo;t let you put up with for me... ever.... Those cigars at Como: do you
      suppose I didn&rsquo;t know it was for me? And this too? Well, it won&rsquo;t do... it
      won&rsquo;t do....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, as if his courage failed him; and she moaned out: &ldquo;But your
      writing&mdash;if your book&rsquo;s a success....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor Susy&mdash;that&rsquo;s all part of the humbug. We both know that my
      sort of writing will never pay. And what&rsquo;s the alternative except more of
      the same kind of baseness? And getting more and more blunted to it? At
      least, till now, I&rsquo;ve minded certain things; I don&rsquo;t want to go on till I
      find myself taking them for granted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She reached out a timid hand. &ldquo;But you needn&rsquo;t ever, dear... if you&rsquo;d only
      leave it to me....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew back sharply. &ldquo;That seems simple to you, I suppose? Well, men are
      different.&rdquo; He walked toward the dressing-table and glanced at the little
      enamelled clock which had been one of her wedding-presents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time to dress, isn&rsquo;t it? Shall you mind if I leave you to dine with
      Streffy, and whoever else is coming? I&rsquo;d rather like a long tramp, and no
      more talking just at present except with myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He passed her by and walked rapidly out of the room. Susy stood
      motionless, unable to lift a detaining hand or to find a final word of
      appeal. On her disordered dressing-table Mrs. Vanderlyn&rsquo;s gifts glittered
      in the rosy lamp-light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes: men were different, as he said.
    </p>


<h3>XI.</h3>

    <p>
      <span class="smcap">But</span> there were necessary accommodations, there always had been; Nick in
      old times, had been the first to own it.... How they had laughed at the
      Perpendicular People, the people who went by on the other side (since you
      couldn&rsquo;t be a good Samaritan without stooping over and poking into heaps
      of you didn&rsquo;t know what)! And now Nick had suddenly become
      perpendicular....
    </p>
    <p>
      Susy, that evening, at the head of the dinner table, saw&mdash;in the
      breaks between her scudding thoughts&mdash;the nauseatingly familiar faces
      of the people she called her friends: Strefford, Fred Gillow, a giggling
      fool of a young Breckenridge, of their New York group, who had arrived
      that day, and Prince Nerone Altineri, Ursula&rsquo;s Prince, who, in Ursula&rsquo;s
      absence at a tiresome cure, had, quite simply and naturally, preferred to
      join her husband at Venice. Susy looked from one to the other of them, as
      if with newly-opened eyes, and wondered what life would be like with no
      faces but such as theirs to furnish it....
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, Nick had become perpendicular!... After all, most people went through
      life making a given set of gestures, like dance-steps learned in advance.
      If your dancing manual told you at a given time to be perpendicular, you
      had to be, automatically&mdash;and that was Nick!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what on earth, Susy,&rdquo; Gillow&rsquo;s puzzled voice suddenly came to her as
      from immeasurable distances, &ldquo;Are you going to do in this beastly stifling
      hole for the rest of the summer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask Nick, my dear fellow,&rdquo; Strefford answered for her; and: &ldquo;By the way,
      where is Nick&mdash;if one may ask?&rdquo; young Breckenridge interposed,
      glancing up to take belated note of his host&rsquo;s absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dining out,&rdquo; said Susy glibly. &ldquo;People turned up: blighting bores that I
      wouldn&rsquo;t have dared to inflict on you.&rdquo; How easily the old familiar
      fibbing came to her!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The kind to whom you say, &lsquo;Now mind you look me up&rsquo;; and then spend the
      rest of your life dodging-like our good Hickses,&rdquo; Strefford amplified.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hickses&mdash;but, of course, Nick was with the Hickses! It went
      through Susy like a knife, and the dinner she had so lightly fibbed became
      a hateful truth. She said to herself feverishly: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call him up there
      after dinner&mdash;and then he will feel silly&rdquo;&mdash;but only to remember
      that the Hickses, in their mediaeval setting, had of course sternly denied
      themselves a telephone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact of Nick&rsquo;s temporary inaccessibility&mdash;since she was now
      convinced that he was really at the Hickses&rsquo;&mdash;turned her distress to
      a mocking irritation. Ah, that was where he carried his principles, his
      standards, or whatever he called the new set of rules he had suddenly
      begun to apply to the old game! It was stupid of her not to have guessed
      it at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the Hickses&mdash;Nick adores them, you know. He&rsquo;s going to marry
      Coral next,&rdquo; she laughed out, flashing the joke around the table with all
      her practiced flippancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord!&rdquo; grasped Gillow, inarticulate: while the Prince displayed the
      unsurprised smile which Susy accused him of practicing every morning with
      his Mueller exercises.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Susy felt Strefford&rsquo;s eyes upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with me? Too much rouge?&rdquo; she asked, passing her arm in
      his as they left the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No: too little. Look at yourself,&rdquo; he answered in a low tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, in these cadaverous old looking-glasses-everybody looks fished up
      from the canal!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She jerked away from him to spin down the long floor of the sala, hands on
      hips, whistling a rag-time tune. The Prince and young Breckenridge caught
      her up, and she spun back with the latter, while Gillow&mdash;it was believed to
      be his sole accomplishment&mdash;snapped his fingers in simulation of bones, and
      shuffled after the couple on stamping feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Susy sank down on a sofa near the window, fanning herself with a floating
      scarf, and the men foraged for cigarettes, and rang for the gondoliers,
      who came in with trays of cooling drinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what next&mdash;this ain&rsquo;t all, is it?&rdquo; Gillow presently queried,
      from the divan where he lolled half-asleep with dripping brow. Fred
      Gillow, like Nature, abhorred a void, and it was inconceivable to him that
      every hour of man&rsquo;s rational existence should not furnish a motive for
      getting up and going somewhere else. Young Breckenridge, who took the same
      view, and the Prince, who earnestly desired to, reminded the company that
      somebody they knew was giving a dance that night at the Lido.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strefford vetoed the Lido, on the ground that he&rsquo;d just come back from
      there, and proposed that they should go out on foot for a change.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? What fun!&rdquo; Susy was up in an instant. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s pay somebody a
      surprise visit&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know who! Streffy, Prince, can&rsquo;t you think of
      somebody who&rsquo;d be particularly annoyed by our arrival?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the list&rsquo;s too long. Let&rsquo;s start, and choose our victim on the way,&rdquo;
       Strefford suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Susy ran to her room for a light cloak, and without changing her
      high-heeled satin slippers went out with the four men. There was no moon&mdash;thank
      heaven there was no moon!&mdash;but the stars hung over them as close as
      fruit, and secret fragrances dropped on them from garden-walls. Susy&rsquo;s
      heart tightened with memories of Como.
    </p>
    <p>
      They wandered on, laughing and dawdling, and yielding to the drifting
      whims of aimless people. Presently someone proposed taking a nearer look
      at the facade of San Giorgio Maggiore, and they hailed a gondola and were
      rowed out through the bobbing lanterns and twanging guitar-strings. When
      they landed again, Gillow, always acutely bored by scenery, and
      particularly resentful of midnight aesthetics, suggested a night club near
      at hand, which was said to be jolly. The Prince warmly supported this
      proposal; but on Susy&rsquo;s curt refusal they started their rambling again,
      circuitously threading the vague dark lanes and making for the Piazza and
      Florian&rsquo;s ices. Suddenly, at a calle-corner, unfamiliar and yet somehow
      known to her, Susy paused to stare about her with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the Hickses&mdash;surely that&rsquo;s their palace? And the windows all lit
      up! They must be giving a party! Oh, do let&rsquo;s go up and surprise them!&rdquo;
       The idea struck her as one of the drollest that she had ever originated,
      and she wondered that her companions should respond so languidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see anything very thrilling in surprising the Hickses,&rdquo; Gillow
      protested, defrauded of possible excitements; and Strefford added: &ldquo;It
      would surprise me more than them if I went.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Susy insisted feverishly: &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know. It may be awfully exciting!
      I have an idea that Coral&rsquo;s announcing her engagement&mdash;her engagement
      to Nick! Come, give me a hand, Streff&mdash;and you the other, Fred-&rdquo; she
      began to hum the first bars of Donna Anna&rsquo;s entrance in Don Giovanni.
      &ldquo;Pity I haven&rsquo;t got a black cloak and a mask....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, your face will do,&rdquo; said Strefford, laying his hand on her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew back, flushing crimson. Breckenridge and the Prince had sprung on
      ahead, and Gillow, lumbering after them, was already halfway up the
      stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My face? My face? What&rsquo;s the matter with my face? Do you know any reason
      why I shouldn&rsquo;t go to the Hickses to-night?&rdquo; Susy broke out in sudden
      wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None whatever; except that if you do it will bore me to death,&rdquo; Strefford
      returned, with serenity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, in that case&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; come on. I hear those fools banging on the door already.&rdquo; He caught
      her by the hand, and they started up the stairway. But on the first
      landing she paused, twisted her hand out of his, and without a word,
      without a conscious thought, dashed down the long flight, across the great
      resounding vestibule and out into the darkness of the calle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strefford caught up with her, and they stood a moment silent in the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Susy&mdash;what the devil&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The matter? Can&rsquo;t you see? That I&rsquo;m tired, that I&rsquo;ve got a splitting
      headache&mdash;that you bore me to death, one and all of you!&rdquo; She turned
      and laid a deprecating hand on his arm. &ldquo;Streffy, old dear, don&rsquo;t mind me:
      but for God&rsquo;s sake find a gondola and send me home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was never any concern of Streff&rsquo;s if people wanted to do things he did
      not understand, and she knew that she could count on his obedience. They
      walked on in silence to the next canal, and he picked up a passing gondola
      and put her in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now go and amuse yourself,&rdquo; she called after him, as the boat shot under
      the nearest bridge. Anything, anything, to be alone, away from the folly
      and futility that would be all she had left if Nick were to drop out of
      her life....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But perhaps he has dropped already&mdash;dropped for good,&rdquo; she thought
      as she set her foot on the Vanderlyn threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      The short summer night was already growing transparent: a new born breeze
      stirred the soiled surface of the water and sent it lapping freshly
      against the old palace doorways. Nearly two o&rsquo;clock! Nick had no doubt
      come back long ago. Susy hurried up the stairs, reassured by the mere
      thought of his nearness. She knew that when their eyes and their lips met
      it would be impossible for anything to keep them apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gondolier dozing on the landing roused himself to receive her, and to
      proffer two envelopes. The upper one was a telegram for Strefford: she
      threw it down again and paused under the lantern hanging from the painted
      vault, the other envelope in her hand. The address it bore was in Nick&rsquo;s
      writing. &ldquo;When did the signore leave this for me? Has he gone out again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gone out again? But the signore had not come in since dinner: of that the
      gondolier was positive, as he had been on duty all the evening. A boy had
      brought the letter&mdash;an unknown boy: he had left it without waiting.
      It must have been about half an hour after the signora had herself gone
      out with her guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Susy, hardly hearing him, fled on to her own room, and there, beside the
      very lamp which, two months before, had illuminated Ellie Vanderlyn&rsquo;s
      fatal letter, she opened Nick&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think me hard on you, dear; but I&rsquo;ve got to work this thing out by
      myself. The sooner the better&mdash;don&rsquo;t you agree? So I&rsquo;m taking the express
      to Milan presently. You&rsquo;ll get a proper letter in a day or two. I wish I
      could think, now, of something to say that would show you I&rsquo;m not a brute&mdash;but
      I can&rsquo;t. N. L.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was not much of the night left in which to sleep, even had a
      semblance of sleep been achievable. The letter fell from Susy&rsquo;s hands, and
      she crept out onto the balcony and cowered there, her forehead pressed
      against the balustrade, the dawn wind stirring in her thin laces. Through
      her closed eyelids and the tightly-clenched fingers pressed against them,
      she felt the penetration of the growing light, the relentless advance of
      another day&mdash;a day without purpose and without meaning&mdash;a day
      without Nick. At length she dropped her hands, and staring from dry lids
      saw a rim of fire above the roofs across the Grand Canal. She sprang up,
      ran back into her room, and dragging the heavy curtains shut across the
      windows, stumbled over in the darkness to the lounge and fell among its
      pillows-face downward&mdash;groping, delving for a deeper night....
    </p>
    <p>
      She started up, stiff and aching, to see a golden wedge of sun on the
      floor at her feet. She had slept, then&mdash;was it possible?&mdash;it
      must be eight or nine o&rsquo;clock already! She had slept&mdash;slept like a
      drunkard&mdash;with that letter on the table at her elbow! Ah, now she
      remembered&mdash;she had dreamed that the letter was a dream! But there,
      inexorably, it lay; and she picked it up, and slowly, painfully re-read
      it. Then she tore it into shreds hunted for a match, and kneeling before
      the empty hearth, as though she were accomplishing some funeral rite, she
      burnt every shred of it to ashes. Nick would thank her for that some day!
    </p>
    <p>
      After a bath and a hurried toilet she began to be aware of feeling younger
      and more hopeful. After all, Nick had merely said that he was going away
      for &ldquo;a day or two.&rdquo; And the letter was not cruel: there were tender things
      in it, showing through the curt words. She smiled at herself a little
      stiffly in the glass, put a dash of red on her colourless lips, and rang
      for the maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coffee, Giovanna, please; and will you tell Mr. Strefford that I should
      like to see him presently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If Nick really kept to his intention of staying away for a few days she
      must trump up some explanation of his absence; but her mind refused to
      work, and the only thing she could think of was to take Strefford into her
      confidence. She knew that he could be trusted in a real difficulty; his
      impish malice transformed itself into a resourceful ingenuity when his
      friends required it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The maid stood looking at her with a puzzled gaze, and Susy somewhat
      sharply repeated her order. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t wake him on purpose,&rdquo; she added,
      foreseeing the probable effect on Strefford&rsquo;s temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, signora, the gentleman is already out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Already out?&rdquo; Strefford, who could hardly be routed from his bed before
      luncheon-time! &ldquo;Is it so late?&rdquo; Susy cried, incredulous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After nine. And the gentleman took the eight o&rsquo;clock train for England.
      Gervaso said he had received a telegram. He left word that he would write
      to the signora.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door closed upon the maid, and Susy continued to gaze at her painted
      image in the glass, as if she had been trying to outstare an importunate
      stranger. There was no one left for her to take counsel of, then&mdash;no
      one but poor Fred Gillow! She made a grimace at the idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what on earth could have summoned Strefford back to England?
    </p>


<h3>XII.</h3>

    <p>
      <span class="smcap">Nick Lansing</span>, in the Milan express, was roused by the same bar of sunshine
      lying across his knees. He yawned, looked with disgust at his stolidly
      sleeping neighbours, and wondered why he had decided to go to Milan, and
      what on earth he should do when he got there. The difficulty about
      trenchant decisions was that the next morning they generally left one
      facing a void....
    </p>
    <p>
      When the train drew into the station at Milan, he scrambled out, got some
      coffee, and having drunk it decided to continue his journey to Genoa. The
      state of being carried passively onward postponed action and dulled
      thought; and after twelve hours of furious mental activity that was
      exactly what he wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      He fell into a doze again, waking now and then to haggard intervals of
      more thinking, and then dropping off to the clank and rattle of the train.
      Inside his head, in his waking intervals, the same clanking and grinding
      of wheels and chains went on unremittingly. He had done all his lucid
      thinking within an hour of leaving the Palazzo Vanderlyn the night before;
      since then, his brain had simply continued to revolve indefatigably about
      the same old problem. His cup of coffee, instead of clearing his thoughts,
      had merely accelerated their pace.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Genoa he wandered about in the hot streets, bought a cheap suit-case
      and some underclothes, and then went down to the port in search of a
      little hotel he remembered there. An hour later he was sitting in the
      coffee-room, smoking and glancing vacantly over the papers while he waited
      for dinner, when he became aware of being timidly but intently examined by
      a small round-faced gentleman with eyeglasses who sat alone at the
      adjoining table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo&mdash;Buttles!&rdquo; Lansing exclaimed, recognising with surprise the
      recalcitrant secretary who had resisted Miss Hicks&rsquo;s endeavour to convert
      him to Tiepolo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Buttles, blushing to the roots of his scant hair, half rose and bowed
      ceremoniously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nick Lansing&rsquo;s first feeling was of annoyance at being disturbed in his
      solitary broodings; his next, of relief at having to postpone them even to
      converse with Mr. Buttles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No idea you were here: is the yacht in harbour?&rdquo; he asked, remembering
      that the Ibis must be just about to spread her wings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Buttles, at salute behind his chair, signed a mute negation: for the
      moment he seemed too embarrassed to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah&mdash;you&rsquo;re here as an advance guard? I remember now&mdash;I saw Miss
      Hicks in Venice the day before yesterday,&rdquo; Lansing continued, dazed at the
      thought that hardly forty-eight hours had passed since his encounter with
      Coral in the Scalzi.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Buttles, instead of speaking, had tentatively approached his table.
      &ldquo;May I take this seat for a moment, Mr. Lansing? Thank you. No, I am not
      here as an advance guard&mdash;though I believe the Ibis is due some time
      to-morrow.&rdquo; He cleared his throat, wiped his eyeglasses on a silk
      handkerchief, replaced them on his nose, and went on solemnly: &ldquo;Perhaps,
      to clear up any possible misunderstanding, I ought to say that I am no
      longer in the employ of Mr. Hicks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lansing glanced at him sympathetically. It was clear that he suffered
      horribly in imparting this information, though his compact face did not
      lend itself to any dramatic display of emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really,&rdquo; Nick smiled, and then ventured: &ldquo;I hope it&rsquo;s not owing to
      conscientious objections to Tiepolo?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Buttles&rsquo;s blush became a smouldering agony. &ldquo;Ah, Miss Hicks mentioned
      to you... told you...? No, Mr. Lansing. I am principled against the effete
      art of Tiepolo, and of all his contemporaries, I confess; but if Miss
      Hicks chooses to surrender herself momentarily to the unwholesome spell of
      the Italian decadence it is not for me to protest or to criticize. Her
      intellectual and aesthetic range so far exceeds my humble capacity that it
      would be ridiculous, unbecoming....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He broke off, and once more wiped a faint moisture from his eyeglasses. It
      was evident that he was suffering from a distress which he longed and yet
      dreaded to communicate. But Nick made no farther effort to bridge the gulf
      of his own preoccupations; and Mr. Buttles, after an expectant pause, went
      on: &ldquo;If you see me here to-day it is only because, after a somewhat abrupt
      departure, I find myself unable to take leave of our friends without a
      last look at the Ibis&mdash;the scene of so many stimulating hours. But I
      must beg you,&rdquo; he added earnestly, &ldquo;should you see Miss Hicks&mdash;or any
      other member of the party&mdash;to make no allusion to my presence in
      Genoa. I wish,&rdquo; said Mr. Buttles with simplicity, &ldquo;to preserve the
      strictest incognito.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lansing glanced at him kindly. &ldquo;Oh, but&mdash;isn&rsquo;t that a little
      unfriendly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No other course is possible, Mr. Lansing,&rdquo; said the ex-secretary, &ldquo;and I
      commit myself to your discretion. The truth is, if I am here it is not to
      look once more at the Ibis, but at Miss Hicks: once only. You will
      understand me, and appreciate what I am suffering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bowed again, and trotted away on his small, tightly-booted feet;
      pausing on the threshold to say: &ldquo;From the first it was hopeless,&rdquo; before
      he disappeared through the glass doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      A gleam of commiseration flashed through Nick&rsquo;s mind: there was something
      quaintly poignant in the sight of the brisk and efficient Mr. Buttles
      reduced to a limp image of unrequited passion. And what a painful surprise
      to the Hickses to be thus suddenly deprived of the secretary who possessed
      &ldquo;the foreign languages&rdquo;! Mr. Beck kept the accounts and settled with the
      hotel-keepers; but it was Mr. Buttles&rsquo;s loftier task to entertain in their
      own tongues the unknown geniuses who flocked about the Hickses, and Nick
      could imagine how disconcerting his departure must be on the eve of their
      Grecian cruise which Mrs. Hicks would certainly call an Odyssey.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next moment the vision of Coral&rsquo;s hopeless suitor had faded, and Nick
      was once more spinning around on the wheel of his own woes. The night
      before, when he had sent his note to Susy, from a little restaurant close
      to Palazzo Vanderlyn that they often patronized, he had done so with the
      firm intention of going away for a day or two in order to collect his wits
      and think over the situation. But after his letter had been entrusted to
      the landlord&rsquo;s little son, who was a particular friend of Susy&rsquo;s, Nick had
      decided to await the lad&rsquo;s return. The messenger had not been bidden to
      ask for an answer; but Nick, knowing the friendly and inquisitive Italian
      mind, was almost sure that the boy, in the hope of catching a glimpse of
      Susy, would linger about while the letter was carried up. And he pictured
      the maid knocking at his wife&rsquo;s darkened room, and Susy dashing some
      powder on her tear-stained face before she turned on the light&mdash;poor
      foolish child!
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy had returned rather sooner than Nick expected, and he had brought
      no answer, but merely the statement that the signora was out: that
      everybody was out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The signora and the four gentlemen who were dining at the palace. They
      all went out together on foot soon after dinner. There was no one to whom
      I could give the note but the gondolier on the landing, for the signora
      had said she would be very late, and had sent the maid to bed; and the
      maid had, of course, gone out immediately with her innamorato.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah&mdash;&rdquo; said Nick, slipping his reward into the boy&rsquo;s hand, and
      walking out of the restaurant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Susy had gone out&mdash;gone out with their usual band, as she did every
      night in these sultry summer weeks, gone out after her talk with Nick, as
      if nothing had happened, as if his whole world and hers had not crashed in
      ruins at their feet. Ah, poor Susy! After all, she had merely obeyed the
      instinct of self preservation, the old hard habit of keeping up, going
      ahead and hiding her troubles; unless indeed the habit had already
      engendered indifference, and it had become as easy for her as for most of
      her friends to pass from drama to dancing, from sorrow to the cinema. What
      of soul was left, he wondered&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      His train did not start till midnight, and after leaving the restaurant
      Nick tramped the sultry by-ways till his tired legs brought him to a
      standstill under the vine-covered pergola of a gondolier&rsquo;s wine-shop at a
      landing close to the Piazzetta. There he could absorb cooling drinks until
      it was time to go to the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was after eleven, and he was beginning to look about for a boat, when a
      black prow pushed up to the steps, and with much chaff and laughter a
      party of young people in evening dress jumped out. Nick, from under the
      darkness of the vine, saw that there was only one lady among them, and it
      did not need the lamp above the landing to reveal her identity. Susy,
      bareheaded and laughing, a light scarf slipping from her bare shoulders, a
      cigarette between her fingers, took Strefford&rsquo;s arm and turned in the
      direction of Florian&rsquo;s, with Gillow, the Prince and young Breckenridge in
      her wake....
    </p>
    <p>
      Nick had relived this rapid scene hundreds of times during his hours in
      the train and his aimless trampings through the streets of Genoa. In that
      squirrel-wheel of a world of his and Susy&rsquo;s you had to keep going or drop
      out&mdash;and Susy, it was evident, had chosen to keep going. Under the
      lamp-flare on the landing he had had a good look at her face, and had seen
      that the mask of paint and powder was carefully enough adjusted to hide
      any ravages the scene between them might have left. He even fancied that
      she had dropped a little atropine into her eyes....
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no time to spare if he meant to catch the midnight train, and no
      gondola in sight but that which his wife had just left. He sprang into it,
      and bade the gondolier carry him to the station. The cushions, as he
      leaned back, gave out a breath of her scent; and in the glare of electric
      light at the station he saw at his feet a rose which had fallen from her
      dress. He ground his heel into it as he got out.
    </p>
    <p>
      There it was, then; that was the last picture he was to have of her. For
      he knew now that he was not going back; at least not to take up their life
      together. He supposed he should have to see her once, to talk things over,
      settle something for their future. He had been sincere in saying that he
      bore her no ill-will; only he could never go back into that slough again.
      If he did, he knew he would inevitably be drawn under, slipping downward
      from concession to concession....
    </p>
    <p>
      The noises of a hot summer night in the port of Genoa would have kept the
      most care-free from slumber; but though Nick lay awake he did not notice
      them, for the tumult in his brain was more deafening. Dawn brought a
      negative relief, and out of sheer weariness he dropped into a heavy sleep.
      When he woke it was nearly noon, and from his window he saw the well-known
      outline of the Ibis standing up dark against the glitter of the harbour.
      He had no fear of meeting her owners, who had doubtless long since landed
      and betaken themselves to cooler and more fashionable regions: oddly
      enough, the fact seemed to accentuate his loneliness, his sense of having
      no one on earth to turn to. He dressed, and wandered out disconsolately to
      pick up a cup of coffee in some shady corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he drank his coffee his thoughts gradually cleared. It became obvious
      to him that he had behaved like a madman or a petulant child&mdash;he
      preferred to think it was like a madman. If he and Susy were to separate
      there was no reason why it should not be done decently and quietly, as
      such transactions were habitually managed among people of their kind. It
      seemed grotesque to introduce melodrama into their little world of
      unruffled Sybarites, and he felt inclined, now, to smile at the
      incongruity of his gesture.... But suddenly his eyes filled with tears.
      The future without Susy was unbearable, inconceivable. Why, after all,
      should they separate? At the question, her soft face seemed close to his,
      and that slight lift of the upper lip that made her smile so exquisite.
      Well&mdash;he would go back. But not with any presence of going to talk things
      over, come to an agreement, wind up their joint life like a business
      association. No&mdash;if he went back he would go without conditions, for
      good, forever....
    </p>
    <p>
      Only, what about the future? What about the not far-distant day when the
      wedding cheques would have been spent, and Granny&rsquo;s pearls sold, and
      nothing left except unconcealed and unconditional dependence on rich
      friends, the role of the acknowledged hangers-on? Was there no other
      possible solution, no new way of ordering their lives? No&mdash;there was
      none: he could not picture Susy out of her setting of luxury and leisure,
      could not picture either of them living such a life as the Nat Fulmers,
      for instance! He remembered the shabby untidy bungalow in New Hampshire,
      the slatternly servants, uneatable food and ubiquitous children. How could
      he ask Susy to share such a life with him? If he did, she would probably
      have the sense to refuse. Their alliance had been based on a moment&rsquo;s
      midsummer madness; now the score must be paid....
    </p>
    <p>
      He decided to write. If they were to part he could not trust himself to
      see her. He called a waiter, asked for pen and paper, and pushed aside a
      pile of unread newspapers on the corner of the table where his coffee had
      been served. As he did so, his eye lit on a Daily Mail of two days before.
      As a pretext for postponing his letter, he took up the paper and glanced
      down the first page. He read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tragic Yachting Accident in the Solent. The Earl of Altringham and his
      son Viscount d&rsquo;Amblay drowned in midnight collision. Both bodies
      recovered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He read on. He grasped the fact that the disaster had happened the night
      before he had left Venice and that, as the result of a fog in the Solent,
      their old friend Strefford was now Earl of Altringham, and possessor of
      one of the largest private fortunes in England. It was vertiginous to
      think of their old impecunious Streff as the hero of such an adventure.
      And what irony in that double turn of the wheel which, in one day, had
      plunged him, Nick Lansing, into nethermost misery, while it tossed the
      other to the stars!
    </p>
    <p>
      With an intenser precision he saw again Susy&rsquo;s descent from the gondola at
      the calle steps, the sound of her laughter and of Strefford&rsquo;s chaff, the
      way she had caught his arm and clung to it, sweeping the other men on in
      her train. Strefford&mdash;Susy and Strefford!... More than once, Nick had
      noticed the softer inflections of his friend&rsquo;s voice when he spoke to
      Susy, the brooding look in his lazy eyes when they rested on her. In the
      security of his wedded bliss Nick had made light of those signs. The only
      real jealousy he had felt had been of Fred Gillow, because of his
      unlimited power to satisfy a woman&rsquo;s whims. Yet Nick knew that such
      material advantages would never again suffice for Susy. With Strefford it
      was different. She had delighted in his society while he was notoriously
      ineligible; might not she find him irresistible now?
    </p>
    <p>
      The forgotten terms of their bridal compact came back to Nick: the absurd
      agreement on which he and Susy had solemnly pledged their faith. But was
      it so absurd, after all? It had been Susy&rsquo;s suggestion (not his, thank
      God!); and perhaps in making it she had been more serious than he
      imagined. Perhaps, even if their rupture had not occurred, Strefford&rsquo;s
      sudden honours might have caused her to ask for her freedom....
    </p>
    <p>
      Money, luxury, fashion, pleasure: those were the four cornerstones of her
      existence. He had always known it&mdash;she herself had always
      acknowledged it, even in their last dreadful talk together; and once he
      had gloried in her frankness. How could he ever have imagined that, to
      have her fill of these things, she would not in time stoop lower than she
      had yet stooped? Perhaps in giving her up to Strefford he might be saving
      her. At any rate, the taste of the past was now so bitter to him that he
      was moved to thank whatever gods there were for pushing that mortuary
      paragraph under his eye....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Susy, dear [he wrote], the fates seem to have taken our future in hand,
      and spared us the trouble of unravelling it. If I have sometimes been
      selfish enough to forget the conditions on which you agreed to marry me,
      they have come back to me during these two days of solitude. You&rsquo;ve given
      me the best a man can have, and nothing else will ever be worth much to
      me. But since I haven&rsquo;t the ability to provide you with what you want, I
      recognize that I&rsquo;ve no right to stand in your way. We must owe no more
      Venetian palaces to underhand services. I see by the newspapers that
      Streff can now give you as many palaces as you want. Let him have the
      chance&mdash;I fancy he&rsquo;ll jump at it, and he&rsquo;s the best man in sight. I
      wish I were in his shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll write again in a day or two, when I&rsquo;ve collected my wits, and can
      give you an address. NICK.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He added a line on the subject of their modest funds, put the letter into
      an envelope, and addressed it to Mrs. Nicholas Lansing. As he did so, he
      reflected that it was the first time he had ever written his wife&rsquo;s
      married name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;by God, no other woman shall have it after her,&rdquo; he vowed, as
      he groped in his pocketbook for a stamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood up with a stretch of weariness&mdash;the heat was stifling!&mdash;and
      put the letter in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll post it myself, it&rsquo;s safer,&rdquo; he thought; &ldquo;and then what in the name
      of goodness shall I do next, I wonder?&rdquo; He jammed his hat down on his head
      and walked out into the sun-blaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he was turning away from the square by the general Post Office, a white
      parasol waved from a passing cab, and Coral Hicks leaned forward with
      outstretched hand. &ldquo;I knew I&rsquo;d find you,&rdquo; she triumphed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
      driving up and down in this broiling sun for hours, shopping and watching
      for you at the same time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stared at her blankly, too bewildered even to wonder how she knew he
      was in Genoa; and she continued, with the kind of shy imperiousness that
      always made him feel, in her presence, like a member of an orchestra under
      a masterful baton; &ldquo;Now please get right into this carriage, and don&rsquo;t
      keep me roasting here another minute.&rdquo; To the cabdriver she called out:
      &ldquo;Al porto.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nick Lansing sank down beside her. As he did so he noticed a heap of
      bundles at her feet, and felt that he had simply added one more to the
      number. He supposed that she was taking her spoils to the Ibis, and that
      he would be carried up to the deck-house to be displayed with the others.
      Well, it would all help to pass the day&mdash;and by night he would have
      reached some kind of a decision about his future.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the third day after Nick&rsquo;s departure the post brought to the Palazzo
      Vanderlyn three letters for Mrs. Lansing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first to arrive was a word from Strefford, scribbled in the train and
      posted at Turin. In it he briefly said that he had been called home by the
      dreadful accident of which Susy had probably read in the daily papers. He
      added that he would write again from England, and then&mdash;in a blotted
      postscript&mdash;: &ldquo;I wanted uncommonly badly to see you for good-bye, but
      the hour was impossible. Regards to Nick. Do write me just a word to
      Altringham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other two letters, which came together in the afternoon, were both
      from Genoa. Susy scanned the addresses and fell upon the one in her
      husband&rsquo;s writing. Her hand trembled so much that for a moment she could
      not open the envelope. When she had done so, she devoured the letter in a
      flash, and then sat and brooded over the outspread page as it lay on her
      knee. It might mean so many things&mdash;she could read into it so many
      harrowing alternatives of indifference and despair, of irony and
      tenderness! Was he suffering tortures when he wrote it, or seeking only to
      inflict them upon her? Or did the words represent his actual feelings, no
      more and no less, and did he really intend her to understand that he
      considered it his duty to abide by the letter of their preposterous
      compact? He had left her in wrath and indignation, yet, as a closer
      scrutiny revealed, there was not a word of reproach in his brief lines.
      Perhaps that was why, in the last issue, they seemed so cold to her....
      She shivered and turned to the other envelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      The large stilted characters, though half-familiar, called up no definite
      image. She opened the envelope and discovered a post-card of the Ibis,
      canvas spread, bounding over a rippled sea. On the back was written:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So awfully dear of you to lend us Mr. Lansing for a little cruise. You
      may count on our taking the best of care of him.

      PART II
    </h2>

    <h3>
      XIII.
    </h3>

    <p>
      <span class="smcap">When</span> Violet Melrose had said to Susy Branch, the winter before in New
      York: &ldquo;But why on earth don&rsquo;t you and Nick go to my little place at
      Versailles for the honeymoon? I&rsquo;m off to China, and you could have it to
      yourselves all summer,&rdquo; the offer had been tempting enough to make the
      lovers waver.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was such an artless ingenuous little house, so full of the demoralizing
      simplicity of great wealth, that it seemed to Susy just the kind of place
      in which to take the first steps in renunciation. But Nick had objected
      that Paris, at that time of year, would be swarming with acquaintances who
      would hunt them down at all hours; and Susy&rsquo;s own experience had led her
      to remark that there was nothing the very rich enjoyed more than taking
      pot-luck with the very poor. They therefore gave Strefford&rsquo;s villa the
      preference, with an inward proviso (on Susy&rsquo;s part) that Violet&rsquo;s house
      might very conveniently serve their purpose at another season.
    </p>
    <p>
      These thoughts were in her mind as she drove up to Mrs. Melrose&rsquo;s door on
      a rainy afternoon late in August, her boxes piled high on the roof of the
      cab she had taken at the station. She had travelled straight through from
      Venice, stopping in Milan just long enough to pick up a reply to the
      telegram she had despatched to the perfect housekeeper whose permanent
      presence enabled Mrs. Melrose to say: &ldquo;Oh, when I&rsquo;m sick of everything I
      just rush off without warning to my little shanty at Versailles, and live
      there all alone on scrambled eggs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The perfect house-keeper had replied to Susy&rsquo;s enquiry: &ldquo;Am sure Mrs.
      Melrose most happy&rdquo;; and Susy, without further thought, had jumped into a
      Versailles train, and now stood in the thin rain before the sphinx-guarded
      threshold of the pavilion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The revolving year had brought around the season at which Mrs. Melrose&rsquo;s
      house might be convenient: no visitors were to be feared at Versailles at
      the end of August, and though Susy&rsquo;s reasons for seeking solitude were so
      remote from those she had once prefigured, they were none the less cogent.
      To be alone&mdash;alone! After those first exposed days when, in the
      persistent presence of Fred Gillow and his satellites, and in the mocking
      radiance of late summer on the lagoons, she had fumed and turned about in
      her agony like a trapped animal in a cramping cage, to be alone had seemed
      the only respite, the one craving: to be alone somewhere in a setting as
      unlike as possible to the sensual splendours of Venice, under skies as
      unlike its azure roof. If she could have chosen she would have crawled
      away into a dingy inn in a rainy northern town, where she had never been
      and no one knew her. Failing that unobtainable luxury, here she was on the
      threshold of an empty house, in a deserted place, under lowering skies.
      She had shaken off Fred Gillow, sulkily departing for his moor (where she
      had half-promised to join him in September); the Prince, young
      Breckenridge, and the few remaining survivors of the Venetian group, had
      dispersed in the direction of the Engadine or Biarritz; and now she could
      at least collect her wits, take stock of herself, and prepare the
      countenance with which she was to face the next stage in her career. Thank
      God it was raining at Versailles!
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened, she heard voices in the drawing-room, and a slender
      languishing figure appeared on the threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darling!&rdquo; Violet Melrose cried in an embrace, drawing her into the dusky
      perfumed room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I thought you were in China!&rdquo; Susy stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In China... in China,&rdquo; Mrs. Melrose stared with dreamy eyes, and Susy
      remembered her drifting disorganised life, a life more planless, more
      inexplicable than that of any of the other ephemeral beings blown about
      upon the same winds of pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Madam, I thought so myself till I got a wire from Mrs. Melrose last
      evening,&rdquo; remarked the perfect house-keeper, following with Susy&rsquo;s
      handbag.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Melrose clutched her cavernous temples in her attenuated hands. &ldquo;Of
      course, of course! I had meant to go to China&mdash;no, India.... But I&rsquo;ve
      discovered a genius... and Genius, you know....&rdquo; Unable to complete her
      thought, she sank down upon a pillowy divan, stretched out an arm, cried:
      &ldquo;Fulmer! Fulmer!&rdquo; and, while Susy Lansing stood in the middle of the room
      with widening eyes, a man emerged from the more deeply cushioned and
      scented twilight of some inner apartment, and she saw with surprise Nat
      Fulmer, the good Nat Fulmer of the New Hampshire bungalow and the
      ubiquitous progeny, standing before her in lordly ease, his hands in his
      pockets, a cigarette between his lips, his feet solidly planted in the
      insidious depths of one of Violet Melrose&rsquo;s white leopard skins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Susy!&rdquo; he shouted with open arms; and Mrs. Melrose murmured: &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t
      know, then? You hadn&rsquo;t heard of his masterpieces?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spite of herself, Susy burst into a laugh. &ldquo;Is Nat your genius?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Melrose looked at her reproachfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fulmer laughed. &ldquo;No; I&rsquo;m Grace&rsquo;s. But Mrs. Melrose has been our
      Providence, and....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Providence?&rdquo; his hostess interrupted. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk as if you were at a
      prayer-meeting! He had an exhibition in New York... it was the most
      fabulous success. He&rsquo;s come abroad to make studies for the decoration of
      my music-room in New York. Ursula Gillow has given him her garden-house at
      Roslyn to do. And Mrs. Bockheimer&rsquo;s ball-room&mdash;oh, Fulmer, where are
      the cartoons?&rdquo; She sprang up, tossed about some fashion-papers heaped on a
      lacquer table, and sank back exhausted by the effort. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d got as far as
      Brindisi. I&rsquo;ve travelled day and night to be here to meet him,&rdquo; she
      declared. &ldquo;But, you darling,&rdquo; and she held out a caressing hand to Susy,
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m forgetting to ask if you&rsquo;ve had tea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An hour later, over the tea-table, Susy already felt herself mysteriously
      reabsorbed into what had so long been her native element. Ellie Vanderlyn
      had brought a breath of it to Venice; but Susy was then nourished on
      another air, the air of Nick&rsquo;s presence and personality; now that she was
      abandoned, left again to her own devices, she felt herself suddenly at the
      mercy of the influences from which she thought she had escaped.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the queer social whirligig from which she had so lately fled, it seemed
      natural enough that a shake of the box should have tossed Nat Fulmer into
      celebrity, and sent Violet Melrose chasing back from the ends of the earth
      to bask in his success. Susy knew that Mrs. Melrose belonged to the class
      of moral parasites; for in that strange world the parts were sometimes
      reversed, and the wealthy preyed upon the pauper. Wherever there was a
      reputation to batten on, there poor Violet appeared, a harmless vampire in
      pearls who sought only to feed on the notoriety which all her millions
      could not create for her. Any one less versed than Susy in the shallow
      mysteries of her little world would have seen in Violet Melrose a baleful
      enchantress, in Nat Fulmer her helpless victim. Susy knew better. Violet,
      poor Violet, was not even that. The insignificant Ellie Vanderlyn, with
      her brief trivial passions, her artless mixture of amorous and social
      interests, was a woman with a purpose, a creature who fulfilled herself;
      but Violet was only a drifting interrogation.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what of Fulmer? Mustering with new eyes his short sturdily-built
      figure, his nondescript bearded face, and the eyes that dreamed and
      wandered, and then suddenly sank into you like claws, Susy seemed to have
      found the key to all his years of dogged toil, his indifference to
      neglect, indifference to poverty, indifference to the needs of his growing
      family.... Yes: for the first time she saw that he looked commonplace
      enough to be a genius&mdash;was a genius, perhaps, even though it was
      Violet Melrose who affirmed it! Susy looked steadily at Fulmer, their eyes
      met, and he smiled at her faintly through his beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I did discover him&mdash;I did,&rdquo; Mrs. Melrose was insisting, from
      the depths of the black velvet divan in which she lay sunk like a wan
      Nereid in a midnight sea. &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t believe a word that Ursula Gillow
      tells you about having pounced on his &lsquo;Spring Snow Storm&rsquo; in a dark corner
      of the American Artists&rsquo; exhibition&mdash;skied, if you please! They skied
      him less than a year ago! And naturally Ursula never in her life looked
      higher than the first line at a picture-show. And now she actually
      pretends... oh, for pity&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t say it doesn&rsquo;t matter, Fulmer! Your
      saying that just encourages her, and makes people think she did. When, in
      reality, any one who saw me at the exhibition on varnishing-day.... Who?
      Well, Eddy Breckenridge, for instance. He was in Egypt, you say? Perhaps
      he was! As if one could remember the people about one, when suddenly one
      comes upon a great work of art, as St. Paul did&mdash;didn&rsquo;t he?&mdash;and
      the scales fell from his eyes. Well... that&rsquo;s exactly what happened to me
      that day... and Ursula, everybody knows, was down at Roslyn at the time,
      and didn&rsquo;t come up for the opening of the exhibition at all. And Fulmer
      sits there and laughs, and says it doesn&rsquo;t matter, and that he&rsquo;ll paint
      another picture any day for me to discover!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susy had rung the door-bell with a hand trembling with eagerness&mdash;eagerness
      to be alone, to be quiet, to stare her situation in the face, and collect
      herself before she came out again among her kind. She had stood on the
      door-step, cowering among her bags, counting the instants till a step
      sounded and the door-knob turned, letting her in from the searching glare
      of the outer world.... And now she had sat for an hour in Violet&rsquo;s
      drawing-room, in the very house where her honey-moon might have been
      spent; and no one had asked her where she had come from, or why she was
      alone, or what was the key to the tragedy written on her shrinking
      face....
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the way of the world they lived in. Nobody questioned, nobody
      wondered any more&mdash;because nobody had time to remember. The old risk of
      prying curiosity, of malicious gossip, was virtually over: one was left
      with one&rsquo;s drama, one&rsquo;s disaster, on one&rsquo;s hands, because there was nobody
      to stop and notice the little shrouded object one was carrying. As Susy
      watched the two people before her, each so frankly unaffected by her
      presence, Violet Melrose so engrossed in her feverish pursuit of
      notoriety, Fulmer so plunged in the golden sea of his success, she felt
      like a ghost making inaudible and imperceptible appeals to the grosser
      senses of the living.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I wanted to be alone,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m alone enough, in all
      conscience.&rdquo; There was a deathly chill in such security. She turned to
      Fulmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Grace?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He beamed back without sign of embarrassment. &ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s here, naturally&mdash;we&rsquo;re
      in Paris, kids and all. In a pension, where we can polish up the lingo.
      But I hardly ever lay eyes on her, because she&rsquo;s as deep in music as I am
      in paint; it was as big a chance for her as for me, you see, and she&rsquo;s
      making the most of it, fiddling and listening to the fiddlers. Well, it&rsquo;s
      a considerable change from New Hampshire.&rdquo; He looked at her dreamily, as
      if making an intense effort to detach himself from his dream, and situate
      her in the fading past. &ldquo;Remember the bungalow? And Nick&mdash;ah, how&rsquo;s
      Nick?&rdquo; he brought out triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;darling Nick?&rdquo; Mrs. Melrose chimed in; and Susy, her head
      erect, her cheeks aflame, declared with resonance: &ldquo;Most awfully well&mdash;splendidly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not here, though?&rdquo; from Fulmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. He&rsquo;s off travelling&mdash;cruising.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Melrose&rsquo;s attention was faintly roused. &ldquo;With anybody interesting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; you wouldn&rsquo;t know them. People we met....&rdquo; She did not have to
      continue, for her hostess&rsquo;s gaze had again strayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve come for your clothes, I suppose, darling? Don&rsquo;t listen to
      people who say that skirts are to be wider. I&rsquo;ve discovered a new woman&mdash;a
      Genius&mdash;and she absolutely swathes you.... Her name&rsquo;s my secret; but
      we&rsquo;ll go to her together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susy rose from her engulphing armchair. &ldquo;Do you mind if I go up to my
      room? I&rsquo;m rather tired&mdash;coming straight through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, dear. I think there are some people coming to dinner... Mrs.
      Match will tell you. She has such a memory.... Fulmer, where on earth are
      those cartoons of the music-room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Their voices pursued Susy upstairs, as, in Mrs. Match&rsquo;s perpendicular
      wake, she mounted to the white-panelled room with its gay linen hangings
      and the low bed heaped with more cushions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we&rsquo;d come here,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;everything might have been different.&rdquo;
       And she shuddered at the sumptuous memories of the Palazzo Vanderlyn, and
      the great painted bedroom where she had met her doom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Match, hoping she would find everything, and mentioning that dinner
      was not till nine, shut her softly in among her terrors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Find everything?&rdquo; Susy echoed the phrase. Oh, yes, she would always find
      everything: every time the door shut on her now, and the sound of voices
      ceased, her memories would be there waiting for her, every one of them,
      waiting quietly, patiently, obstinately, like poor people in a doctor&rsquo;s
      office, the people who are always last to be attended to, but whom nothing
      will discourage or drive away, people to whom time is nothing, fatigue
      nothing, hunger nothing, other engagements nothing: who just wait....
      Thank heaven, after all, that she had not found the house empty, if,
      whenever she returned to her room, she was to meet her memories there!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was just a week since Nick had left her. During that week, crammed with
      people, questions, packing, explaining, evading, she had believed that in
      solitude lay her salvation. Now she understood that there was nothing she
      was so unprepared for, so unfitted for. When, in all her life, had she
      ever been alone? And how was she to bear it now, with all these ravening
      memories besetting her!
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinner not till nine? What on earth was she to do till nine o&rsquo;clock? She
      knelt before her boxes, and feverishly began to unpack.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradually, imperceptibly, the subtle influences of her old life were
      stealing into her. As she pulled out her tossed and crumpled dresses she
      remembered Violet&rsquo;s emphatic warning: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t believe the people who tell
      you that skirts are going to be wider.&rdquo; Were hers, perhaps, too wide as it
      was? She looked at her limp raiment, piling itself up on bed and sofa, and
      understood that, according to Violet&rsquo;s standards, and that of all her set,
      those dresses, which Nick had thought so original and exquisite, were
      already commonplace and dowdy, fit only to be passed on to poor relations
      or given to one&rsquo;s maid. And Susy would have to go on wearing them till
      they fell to bits&mdash;or else.... Well, or else begin the old life again in
      some new form....
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed aloud at the turn of her thoughts. Dresses? How little they
      had mattered a few short weeks ago! And now, perhaps, they would again be
      one of the foremost considerations in her life. How could it be otherwise,
      if she were to return again to her old dependence on Ellie Vanderlyn,
      Ursula Gillow, Violet Melrose? And beyond that, only the Bockheimers and
      their kind awaited her....
    </p>
    <p>
      A knock on the door&mdash;what a relief! It was Mrs. Match again, with a
      telegram. To whom had Susy given her new address? With a throbbing heart
      she tore open the envelope and read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall be in Paris Friday for twenty-four hours where can I see you write
      Nouveau Luxe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ah, yes&mdash;she remembered now: she had written to Strefford! And this
      was his answer: he was coming. She dropped into a chair, and tried to
      think. What on earth had she said in her letter? It had been mainly, of
      course, one of condolence; but now she remembered having added, in a
      precipitate postscript: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t give your message to Nick, for he&rsquo;s gone
      off with the Hickses&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know where, or for how long. It&rsquo;s all right,
      of course: it was in our bargain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had not meant to put in that last phrase; but as she sealed her letter
      to Strefford her eye had fallen on Nick&rsquo;s missive, which lay beside it.
      Nothing in her husband&rsquo;s brief lines had embittered her as much as the
      allusion to Strefford. It seemed to imply that Nick&rsquo;s own plans were made,
      that his own future was secure, and that he could therefore freely and
      handsomely take thought for hers, and give her a pointer in the right
      direction. Sudden rage had possessed her at the thought: where she had at
      first read jealousy she now saw only a cold providence, and in a blur of
      tears she had scrawled her postscript to Strefford. She remembered that
      she had not even asked him to keep her secret. Well&mdash;after all, what
      would it matter if people should already know that Nick had left her?
      Their parting could not long remain a mystery, and the fact that it was
      known might help her to keep up a presence of indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was in the bargain&mdash;in the bargain,&rdquo; rang through her brain as
      she re-read Strefford&rsquo;s telegram. She understood that he had snatched the
      time for this hasty trip solely in the hope of seeing her, and her eyes
      filled. The more bitterly she thought of Nick the more this proof of
      Strefford&rsquo;s friendship moved her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clock, to her relief, reminded her that it was time to dress for
      dinner. She would go down presently, chat with Violet and Fulmer, and with
      Violet&rsquo;s other guests, who would probably be odd and amusing, and too much
      out of her world to embarrass her by awkward questions. She would sit at a
      softly-lit table, breathe delicate scents, eat exquisite food (trust Mrs.
      Match!), and be gradually drawn again under the spell of her old
      associations. Anything, anything but to be alone....
    </p>
    <p>
      She dressed with even more than her habitual care, reddened her lips
      attentively, brushed the faintest bloom of pink over her drawn cheeks, and
      went down&mdash;to meet Mrs. Match coming up with a tray.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Madam, I thought you were too tired.... I was bringing it up to you
      myself&mdash;just a little morsel of chicken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susy, glancing past her, saw, through the open door, that the lamps were
      not lit in the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, I&rsquo;m not tired, thank you. I thought Mrs. Melrose expected friends
      at dinner!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friends at dinner-to-night?&rdquo; Mrs. Match heaved a despairing sigh.
      Sometimes, the sigh seemed to say, her mistress put too great a strain
      upon her. &ldquo;Why, Mrs. Melrose and Mr. Fulmer were engaged to dine in Paris.
      They left an hour ago. Mrs. Melrose told me she&rsquo;d told you,&rdquo; the
      house-keeper wailed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Susy kept her little fixed smile. &ldquo;I must have misunderstood. In that
      case... well, yes, if it&rsquo;s no trouble, I believe I will have my tray
      upstairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slowly she turned, and followed the housekeeper up into the dread solitude
      she had just left.
    </p>


<h3>XIV.</h3>

    <p>
      <span class="smcap">The</span> next day a lot of people turned up unannounced for luncheon. They were
      not of the far-fetched and the exotic, in whom Mrs. Melrose now
      specialized, but merely commonplace fashionable people belonging to Susy&rsquo;s
      own group, people familiar with the amusing romance of her penniless
      marriage, and to whom she had to explain (though none of them really
      listened to the explanation) that Nick was not with her just now but had
      gone off cruising... cruising in the AEgean with friends... getting up
      material for his book (this detail had occurred to her in the night).
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the kind of encounter she had most dreaded; but it proved, after
      all, easy enough to go through compared with those endless hours of
      turning to and fro, the night before, in the cage of her lonely room.
      Anything, anything, but to be alone....
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradually, from the force of habit, she found herself actually in tune
      with the talk of the luncheon table, interested in the references to
      absent friends, the light allusions to last year&rsquo;s loves and quarrels,
      scandals and absurdities. The women, in their pale summer dresses, were so
      graceful, indolent and sure of themselves, the men so easy and
      good-humoured! Perhaps, after all, Susy reflected, it was the world she
      was meant for, since the other, the brief Paradise of her dreams, had
      already shut its golden doors upon her. And then, as they sat on the
      terrace after luncheon, looking across at the yellow tree-tops of the
      park, one of the women said something&mdash;made just an allusion&mdash;that
      Susy would have let pass unnoticed in the old days, but that now filled
      her with a sudden deep disgust.... She stood up and wandered away, away
      from them all through the fading garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days later Susy and Strefford sat on the terrace of the Tuileries
      above the Seine. She had asked him to meet her there, with the desire to
      avoid the crowded halls and drawing-room of the Nouveau Luxe where, even
      at that supposedly &ldquo;dead&rdquo; season, people one knew were always drifting to
      and fro; and they sat on a bench in the pale sunlight, the discoloured
      leaves heaped at their feet, and no one to share their solitude but a lame
      working-man and a haggard woman who were lunching together mournfully at
      the other end of the majestic vista.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strefford, in his new mourning, looked unnaturally prosperous and
      well-valeted; but his ugly untidy features remained as undisciplined, his
      smile as whimsical, as of old. He had been on cool though friendly terms
      with the pompous uncle and the poor sickly cousin whose joint
      disappearance had so abruptly transformed his future; and it was his way
      to understate his feelings rather than to pretend more than he felt.
      Nevertheless, beneath his habitual bantering tone Susy discerned a change.
      The disaster had shocked him profoundly; already, in his brief sojourn
      among his people and among the great possessions so tragically acquired,
      old instincts had awakened, forgotten associations had spoken in him. Susy
      listened to him wistfully, silenced by her imaginative perception of the
      distance that these things had put between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was horrible... seeing them both there together, laid out in that
      hideous Pugin chapel at Altringham... the poor boy especially. I suppose
      that&rsquo;s really what&rsquo;s cutting me up now,&rdquo; he murmured, almost
      apologetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s more than that&mdash;more than you know,&rdquo; she insisted; but he
      jerked back: &ldquo;Now, my dear, don&rsquo;t be edifying, please,&rdquo; and fumbled for a
      cigarette in the pocket which was already beginning to bulge with his
      miscellaneous properties.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now about you&mdash;for that&rsquo;s what I came for,&rdquo; he continued,
      turning to her with one of his sudden movements. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t make head or
      tail of your letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused a moment to steady her voice. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you? I suppose you&rsquo;d
      forgotten my bargain with Nick. He hadn&rsquo;t&mdash;and he&rsquo;s asked me to fulfil it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Strefford stared. &ldquo;What&mdash;that nonsense about your setting each other
      free if either of you had the chance to make a good match?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She signed &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he&rsquo;s actually asked you&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well: practically. He&rsquo;s gone off with the Hickses. Before going he wrote
      me that we&rsquo;d better both consider ourselves free. And Coral sent me a
      postcard to say that she would take the best of care of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Strefford mused, his eyes upon his cigarette. &ldquo;But what the deuce led up
      to all this? It can&rsquo;t have happened like that, out of a clear sky.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susy flushed, hesitated, looked away. She had meant to tell Strefford the
      whole story; it had been one of her chief reasons for wishing to see him
      again, and half-unconsciously, perhaps, she had hoped, in his laxer
      atmosphere, to recover something of her shattered self-esteem. But now she
      suddenly felt the impossibility of confessing to anyone the depths to
      which Nick&rsquo;s wife had stooped. She fancied that her companion guessed the
      nature of her hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me anything you don&rsquo;t want to, you know, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I do want to; only it&rsquo;s difficult. You see&mdash;we had so very
      little money....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Nick&mdash;who was thinking of his book, and of all sorts of big
      things, fine things&mdash;didn&rsquo;t realise... left it all to me... to
      manage....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stumbled over the word, remembering how Nick had always winced at it.
      But Strefford did not seem to notice her, and she hurried on, unfolding in
      short awkward sentences the avowal of their pecuniary difficulties, and of
      Nick&rsquo;s inability to understand that, to keep on with the kind of life they
      were leading, one had to put up with things... accept favours....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Borrow money, you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;yes; and all the rest.&rdquo; No&mdash;decidedly she could not
      reveal to Strefford the episode of Ellie&rsquo;s letters. &ldquo;Nick suddenly felt, I
      suppose, that he couldn&rsquo;t stand it,&rdquo; she continued; &ldquo;and instead of asking
      me to try&mdash;to try to live differently, go off somewhere with him and
      live, like work-people, in two rooms, without a servant, as I was ready to
      do; well, instead he wrote me that it had all been a mistake from the
      beginning, that we couldn&rsquo;t keep it up, and had better recognize the fact;
      and he went off on the Hickses&rsquo; yacht. The last evening that you were in
      Venice&mdash;the day he didn&rsquo;t come back to dinner&mdash;he had gone off
      to Genoa to meet them. I suppose he intends to marry Coral.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Strefford received this in silence. &ldquo;Well&mdash;it was your bargain,
      wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he said at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly: I always told you so. You weren&rsquo;t ready to have him go yet&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She flushed to the forehead. &ldquo;Oh, Streff&mdash;is it really all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A question of time? If you doubt it, I&rsquo;d like to see you try, for a
      while, in those two rooms without a servant; and then let me hear from
      you. Why, my dear, it&rsquo;s only a question of time in a palace, with a steam
      yacht lying off the door-step, and a flock of motors in the garage; look
      around you and see. And did you ever imagine that you and Nick, of all
      people, were going to escape the common doom, and survive like Mr. and
      Mrs. Tithonus, while all about you the eternal passions were crumbling to
      pieces, and your native Divorce-states piling up their revenues?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sat with bent head, the weight of the long years to come pressing like
      a leaden load on her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m so young... life&rsquo;s so long. What does last, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you&rsquo;re too young to believe me, if I were to tell you; though you&rsquo;re
      intelligent enough to understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the hold of the things we all think we could do without. Habits&mdash;they
      outstand the Pyramids. Comforts, luxuries, the atmosphere of ease... above
      all, the power to get away from dulness and monotony, from constraints and
      uglinesses. You chose that power, instinctively, before you were even
      grown up; and so did Nick. And the only difference between you is that
      he&rsquo;s had the sense to see sooner than you that those are the things that
      last, the prime necessities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you don&rsquo;t: at your age one doesn&rsquo;t reason one&rsquo;s materialism.
      And besides you&rsquo;re mortally hurt that Nick has found out sooner than you,
      and hasn&rsquo;t disguised his discovery under any hypocritical phrases.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely there are people&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;saints and geniuses and heroes: all the fanatics! To which of
      their categories do you suppose we soft people belong? And the heroes and
      the geniuses&mdash;haven&rsquo;t they their enormous frailties and their giant
      appetites? And how should we escape being the victims of our little ones?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sat for a while without speaking. &ldquo;But, Streff, how can you say such
      things, when I know you care: care for me, for instance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Care?&rdquo; He put his hand on hers. &ldquo;But, my dear, it&rsquo;s just the fugitiveness
      of mortal caring that makes it so exquisite! It&rsquo;s because we know we can&rsquo;t
      hold fast to it, or to each other, or to anything....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes... yes... but hush, please! Oh, don&rsquo;t say it!&rdquo; She stood up, the
      tears in her throat, and he rose also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along, then; where do we lunch?&rdquo; he said with a smile, slipping his
      hand through her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. Nowhere. I think I&rsquo;m going back to Versailles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I&rsquo;ve disgusted you so deeply? Just my luck&mdash;when I came over
      to ask you to marry me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed, but he had become suddenly grave. &ldquo;Upon my soul, I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Streff! As if&mdash;now&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not now&mdash;I know. I&rsquo;m aware that even with your accelerated
      divorce methods&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that. I told you it was no use, Streff&mdash;I told you long
      ago, in Venice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shrugged ironically. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not Streff who&rsquo;s asking you now. Streff was
      not a marrying man: he was only trifling with you. The present offer comes
      from an elderly peer of independent means. Think it over, my dear: as many
      days out as you like, and five footmen kept. There&rsquo;s not the least hurry,
      of course; but I rather think Nick himself would advise it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She flushed to the temples, remembering that Nick had; and the remembrance
      made Strefford&rsquo;s sneering philosophy seem less unbearable. Why should she
      not lunch with him, after all? In the first days of his mourning he had
      come to Paris expressly to see her, and to offer her one of the oldest
      names and one of the greatest fortunes in England. She thought of Ursula
      Gillow, Ellie Vanderlyn, Violet Melrose, of their condescending
      kindnesses, their last year&rsquo;s dresses, their Christmas cheques, and all
      the careless bounties that were so easy to bestow and so hard to accept.
      &ldquo;I should rather enjoy paying them back,&rdquo; something in her maliciously
      murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not mean to marry Strefford&mdash;she had not even got as far as
      contemplating the possibility of a divorce but it was undeniable that this
      sudden prospect of wealth and freedom was like fresh air in her lungs. She
      laughed again, but now without bitterness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, then; we&rsquo;ll lunch together. But it&rsquo;s Streff I want to lunch
      with to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; her companion agreed, &ldquo;I rather think that for a tête-à-tête
      he&rsquo;s better company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During their repast in a little restaurant over the Seine, where she
      insisted on the cheapest dishes because she was lunching with &ldquo;Streff,&rdquo; he
      became again his old whimsical companionable self. Once or twice she tried
      to turn the talk to his altered future, and the obligations and interests
      that lay before him; but he shrugged away from the subject, questioning
      her instead about the motley company at Violet Melrose&rsquo;s, and fitting a
      droll or malicious anecdote to each of the people she named.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not till they had finished their coffee, and she was glancing at
      her watch with a vague notion of taking the next train, that he asked
      abruptly: &ldquo;But what are you going to do? You can&rsquo;t stay forever at
      Violet&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; she cried with a shiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then&mdash;you&rsquo;ve got some plan, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I?&rdquo; she wondered, jerked back into grim reality from the soothing
      interlude of their hour together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t drift indefinitely, can you? Unless you mean to go back to the
      old sort of life once for all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She reddened and her eyes filled. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do that, Streff&mdash;I know I
      can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated, and brought out with lowered head: &ldquo;Nick said he would
      write again&mdash;in a few days. I must wait&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, naturally. Don&rsquo;t do anything in a hurry.&rdquo; Strefford also glanced at
      his watch. &ldquo;Garcon, l&rsquo;addition! I&rsquo;m taking the train back to-night, and
      I&rsquo;ve a lot of things left to do. But look here, my dear&mdash;when you
      come to a decision one way or the other let me know, will you? Oh, I don&rsquo;t
      mean in the matter I&rsquo;ve most at heart; we&rsquo;ll consider that closed for the
      present. But at least I can be of use in other ways&mdash;hang it, you
      know, I can even lend you money. There&rsquo;s a new sensation for our jaded
      palates!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Streff... Streff!&rdquo; she could only falter; and he pressed on gaily:
      &ldquo;Try it, now do try it&mdash;I assure you there&rsquo;ll be no interest to pay,
      and no conditions attached. And promise to let me know when you&rsquo;ve decided
      anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked into his humorously puckered eyes, answering. Their friendly
      smile with hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>


<h3>XV.</h3>

    <p>
      <span class="smcap">That</span> hour with Strefford had altered her whole perspective. Instead of
      possible dependence, an enforced return to the old life of connivances and
      concessions, she saw before her&mdash;whenever she chose to take them&mdash;freedom,
      power and dignity. Dignity! It was odd what weight that word had come to
      have for her. She had dimly felt its significance, felt the need of its
      presence in her inmost soul, even in the young thoughtless days when she
      had seemed to sacrifice so little to the austere divinities. And since she
      had been Nick Lansing&rsquo;s wife she had consciously acknowledged it, had
      suffered and agonized when she fell beneath its standard. Yes: to marry
      Strefford would give her that sense of self-respect which, in such a world
      as theirs, only wealth and position could ensure. If she had not the
      mental or moral training to attain independence in any other way, was she
      to blame for seeking it on such terms?
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course there was always the chance that Nick would come back, would
      find life without her as intolerable as she was finding it without him. If
      that happened&mdash;ah, if that happened! Then she would cease to strain
      her eyes into the future, would seize upon the present moment and plunge
      into it to the very bottom of oblivion. Nothing on earth would matter then&mdash;money
      or freedom or pride, or her precious moral dignity, if only she were in
      Nick&rsquo;s arms again!
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was Nick&rsquo;s icy letter, there was Coral Hicks&rsquo;s insolent
      post-card, to show how little chance there was of such a solution. Susy
      understood that, even before the discovery of her transaction with Ellie
      Vanderlyn, Nick had secretly wearied, if not of his wife, at least of the
      life that their marriage compelled him to lead. His passion was not strong
      enough&mdash;had never been strong enough&mdash;to outweigh his prejudices,
      scruples, principles, or whatever one chose to call them. Susy&rsquo;s dignity
      might go up like tinder in the blaze of her love; but his was made of a
      less combustible substance. She had felt, in their last talk together,
      that she had forever destroyed the inner harmony between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well&mdash;there it was, and the fault was doubtless neither hers nor his,
      but that of the world they had grown up in, of their own moral contempt
      for it and physical dependence on it, of his half-talents and her
      half-principles, of the something in them both that was not stout enough
      to resist nor yet pliant enough to yield. She stared at the fact on the
      journey back to Versailles, and all that sleepless night in her room; and
      the next morning, when the housemaid came in with her breakfast tray, she
      felt the factitious energy that comes from having decided, however
      half-heartedly, on a definite course.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had said to herself: &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s no letter from Nick this time next
      week I&rsquo;ll write to Streff&mdash;&rdquo; and the week had passed, and there was
      no letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now three weeks since he had left her, and she had had no word but
      his note from Genoa. She had concluded that, foreseeing the probability of
      her leaving Venice, he would write to her in care of their Paris bank. But
      though she had immediately notified the bank of her change of address no
      communication from Nick had reached her; and she smiled with a touch of
      bitterness at the difficulty he was doubtless finding in the composition
      of the promised letter. Her own scrap-basket, for the first days, had been
      heaped with the fragments of the letters she had begun; and she told
      herself that, since they both found it so hard to write, it was probably
      because they had nothing left to say to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the days at Mrs. Melrose&rsquo;s drifted by as they had been wont to
      drift when, under the roofs of the rich, Susy Branch had marked time
      between one episode and the next of her precarious existence. Her
      experience of such sojourns was varied enough to make her acutely
      conscious of their effect on her temporary hosts; and in the present case
      she knew that Violet was hardly aware of her presence. But if no more than
      tolerated she was at least not felt to be an inconvenience; when your
      hostess forgot about you it proved that at least you were not in her way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Violet, as usual, was perpetually on the wing, for her profound indolence
      expressed itself in a disordered activity. Nat Fulmer had returned to
      Paris; but Susy guessed that his benefactress was still constantly in his
      company, and that when Mrs. Melrose was whirled away in her noiseless
      motor it was generally toward the scene of some new encounter between
      Fulmer and the arts. On these occasions she sometimes offered to carry
      Susy to Paris, and they devoted several long and hectic mornings to the
      dress-makers, where Susy felt herself gradually succumbing to the familiar
      spell of heaped-up finery. It seemed impossible, as furs and laces and
      brocades were tossed aside, brought back, and at last carelessly selected
      from, that anything but the whim of the moment need count in deciding
      whether one should take all or none, or that any woman could be worth
      looking at who did not possess the means to make her choice regardless of
      cost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once alone, and in the street again, the evil fumes would evaporate, and
      daylight re-enter Susy&rsquo;s soul; yet she felt that the old poison was slowly
      insinuating itself into her system. To dispel it she decided one day to
      look up Grace Fulmer. She was curious to know how the happy-go-lucky
      companion of Fulmer&rsquo;s evil days was bearing the weight of his prosperity,
      and she vaguely felt that it would be refreshing to see some one who had
      never been afraid of poverty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The airless pension sitting-room, where she waited while a reluctant
      maid-servant screamed about the house for Mrs. Fulmer, did not have the
      hoped-for effect. It was one thing for Grace to put up with such quarters
      when she shared them with Fulmer; but to live there while he basked in the
      lingering radiance of Versailles, or rolled from chateau to picture
      gallery in Mrs. Melrose&rsquo;s motor, showed a courage that Susy felt unable to
      emulate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear! I knew you&rsquo;d look me up,&rdquo; Grace&rsquo;s joyous voice ran down the
      stairway; and in another moment she was clasping Susy to her tumbled
      person.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nat couldn&rsquo;t remember if he&rsquo;d given you our address, though he promised
      me he would, the last time he was here.&rdquo; She held Susy at arms&rsquo; length,
      beaming upon her with blinking short-sighted eyes: the same old
      dishevelled Grace, so careless of her neglected beauty and her squandered
      youth, so amused and absent-minded and improvident, that the boisterous
      air of the New Hampshire bungalow seemed to enter with her into the little
      air-tight salon.
    </p>
    <p>
      While she poured out the tale of Nat&rsquo;s sudden celebrity, and its
      unexpected consequences, Susy marvelled and dreamed. Was the secret of his
      triumph perhaps due to those long hard unrewarded years, the steadfast
      scorn of popularity, the indifference to every kind of material ease in
      which his wife had so gaily abetted him? Had it been bought at the cost of
      her own freshness and her own talent, of the children&rsquo;s &ldquo;advantages,&rdquo; of
      everything except the closeness of the tie between husband and wife? Well&mdash;it
      was worth the price, no doubt; but what if, now that honours and
      prosperity had come, the tie were snapped, and Grace were left alone among
      the ruins?
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing in her tone or words to suggest such a possibility. Susy
      noticed that her ill-assorted raiment was costlier in quality and more
      professional in cut than the home-made garments which had draped her
      growing bulk at the bungalow: it was clear that she was trying to dress up
      to Nat&rsquo;s new situation. But, above all, she was rejoicing in it, filling
      her hungry lungs with the strong air of his success. It had evidently not
      occurred to her as yet that those who consent to share the bread of
      adversity may want the whole cake of prosperity for themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, it&rsquo;s too wonderful! He&rsquo;s told me to take as many concert and
      opera tickets as I like; he lets me take all the children with me. The big
      concerts don&rsquo;t begin till later; but of course the Opera is always going.
      And there are little things&mdash;there&rsquo;s music in Paris at all seasons.
      And later it&rsquo;s just possible we may get to Munich for a week&mdash;oh,
      Susy!&rdquo; Her hands clasped, her eyes brimming, she drank the new wine of
      life almost sacramentally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember, Susy, when you and Nick came to stay at the bungalow?
      Nat said you&rsquo;d be horrified by our primitiveness&mdash;but I knew better! And I
      was right, wasn&rsquo;t I? Seeing us so happy made you and Nick decide to follow
      our example, didn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; She glowed with the remembrance. &ldquo;And now, what
      are your plans? Is Nick&rsquo;s book nearly done? I suppose you&rsquo;ll have to live
      very economically till he finds a publisher. And the baby, darling&mdash;when is
      that to be? If you&rsquo;re coming home soon I could let you have a lot of the
      children&rsquo;s little old things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re always so dear, Grace. But we haven&rsquo;t any special plans as yet&mdash;not
      even for a baby. And I wish you&rsquo;d tell me all of yours instead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Fulmer asked nothing better: Susy perceived that, so far, the greater
      part of her European experience had consisted in talking about what it was
      to be. &ldquo;Well, you see, Nat is so taken up all day with sight-seeing and
      galleries and meeting important people that he hasn&rsquo;t had time to go about
      with us; and as so few theatres are open, and there&rsquo;s so little music,
      I&rsquo;ve taken the opportunity to catch up with my mending. Junie helps me
      with it now&mdash;she&rsquo;s our eldest, you remember? She&rsquo;s grown into a big
      girl since you saw her. And later, perhaps, we&rsquo;re to travel. And the most
      wonderful thing of all&mdash;next to Nat&rsquo;s recognition, I mean&mdash;is
      not having to contrive and skimp, and give up something every single
      minute. Just think&mdash;Nat has even made special arrangements here in
      the pension, so that the children all have second helpings to everything.
      And when I go up to bed I can think of my music, instead of lying awake
      calculating and wondering how I can make things come out at the end of the
      month. Oh, Susy, that&rsquo;s simply heaven!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susy&rsquo;s heart contracted. She had come to her friend to be taught again the
      lesson of indifference to material things, and instead she was hearing
      from Grace Fulmer&rsquo;s lips the long-repressed avowal of their tyranny. After
      all, that battle with poverty on the New Hampshire hillside had not been
      the easy smiling business that Grace and Nat had made it appear. And yet
      ... and yet....
    </p>
    <p>
      Susy stood up abruptly, and straightened the expensive hat which hung
      irresponsibly over Grace&rsquo;s left ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with it? Junie helped me choose it, and she generally
      knows,&rdquo; Mrs. Fulmer wailed with helpless hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the way you wear it, dearest&mdash;and the bow is rather top-heavy.
      Let me have it a minute, please.&rdquo; Susy lifted the hat from her friend&rsquo;s
      head and began to manipulate its trimming. &ldquo;This is the way Maria Guy or
      Suzanne would do it.... And now go on about Nat....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She listened musingly while Grace poured forth the tale of her husband&rsquo;s
      triumph, of the notices in the papers, the demand for his work, the fine
      ladies&rsquo; battles over their priority in discovering him, and the multiplied
      orders that had resulted from their rivalry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course they&rsquo;re simply furious with each other&mdash;Mrs. Melrose and Mrs.
      Gillow especially&mdash;because each one pretends to have been the first
      to notice his &lsquo;Spring Snow-Storm,&rsquo; and in reality it wasn&rsquo;t either of
      them, but only poor Bill Haslett, an art-critic we&rsquo;ve known for years, who
      chanced on the picture, and rushed off to tell a dealer who was looking
      for a new painter to push.&rdquo; Grace suddenly raised her soft myopic eyes to
      Susy&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;But, do you know, the funny thing is that I believe Nat is
      beginning to forget this, and to believe that it was Mrs. Melrose who
      stopped short in front of his picture on the opening day, and screamed
      out: &lsquo;This is genius!&rsquo; It seems funny he should care so much, when I&rsquo;ve
      always known he had genius&mdash;and he has known it too. But they&rsquo;re all so
      kind to him; and Mrs. Melrose especially. And I suppose it makes a thing
      sound new to hear it said in a new voice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susy looked at her meditatively. &ldquo;And how should you feel if Nat liked too
      much to hear Mrs. Melrose say it? Too much, I mean, to care any longer
      what you felt or thought?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her friend&rsquo;s worn face flushed quickly, and then paled: Susy almost
      repented the question. But Mrs. Fulmer met it with a tranquil dignity.
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t been married long enough, dear, to understand... how people
      like Nat and me feel about such things... or how trifling they seem, in
      the balance... the balance of one&rsquo;s memories.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susy stood up again, and flung her arms about her friend. &ldquo;Oh, Grace,&rdquo; she
      laughed with wet eyes, &ldquo;how can you be as wise as that, and yet not have
      sense enough to buy a decent hat?&rdquo; She gave Mrs. Fulmer a quick embrace
      and hurried away. She had learned her lesson after all; but it was not
      exactly the one she had come to seek.
    </p>
    <p>
      The week she had allowed herself had passed, and still there was no word
      from Nick. She allowed herself yet another day, and that too went by
      without a letter. She then decided on a step from which her pride had
      hitherto recoiled; she would call at the bank and ask for Nick&rsquo;s address.
      She called, embarrassed and hesitating; and was told, after enquiries in
      the post-office department, that Mr. Nicholas Lansing had given no address
      since that of the Palazzo Vanderlyn, three months previously. She went
      back to Versailles that afternoon with the definite intention of writing
      to Strefford unless the next morning&rsquo;s post brought a letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning brought nothing from Nick, but a scribbled message from
      Mrs. Melrose: would Susy, as soon as possible, come into her room for a
      word, Susy jumped up, hurried through her bath, and knocked at her
      hostess&rsquo;s door. In the immense low bed that faced the rich umbrage of the
      park Mrs. Melrose lay smoking cigarettes and glancing over her letters.
      She looked up with her vague smile, and said dreamily: &ldquo;Susy darling, have
      you any particular plans&mdash;for the next few months, I mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susy coloured: she knew the intonation of old, and fancied she understood
      what it implied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plans, dearest? Any number... I&rsquo;m tearing myself away the day after
      to-morrow... to the Gillows&rsquo; moor, very probably,&rdquo; she hastened to
      announce.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of the relief she had expected to read on Mrs. Melrose&rsquo;s dramatic
      countenance she discovered there the blankest disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, really? That&rsquo;s too bad. Is it absolutely settled&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As far as I&rsquo;m concerned,&rdquo; said Susy crisply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other sighed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too sorry. You see, dear, I&rsquo;d meant to ask you to
      stay on here quietly and look after the Fulmer children. Fulmer and I are
      going to Spain next week&mdash;I want to be with him when he makes his
      studies, receives his first impressions; such a marvellous experience, to
      be there when he and Velasquez meet!&rdquo; She broke off, lost in prospective
      ecstasy. &ldquo;And, you see, as Grace Fulmer insists on coming with us&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there are the five children&mdash;such a problem,&rdquo; sighed the
      benefactress. &ldquo;If you were at a loose end, you know, dear, while Nick&rsquo;s
      away with his friends, I could really make it worth your while....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So awfully good of you, Violet; only I&rsquo;m not, as it happens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oh the relief of being able to say that, gaily, firmly and even
      truthfully! Take charge of the Fulmer children, indeed! Susy remembered
      how Nick and she had fled from them that autumn afternoon in New
      Hampshire. The offer gave her a salutary glimpse of the way in which, as
      the years passed, and she lost her freshness and novelty, she would more
      and more be used as a convenience, a stop-gap, writer of notes, runner of
      errands, nursery governess or companion. She called to mind several
      elderly women of her acquaintance, pensioners of her own group, who still
      wore its livery, struck its attitudes and chattered its jargon, but had
      long since been ruthlessly relegated to these slave-ant offices. Never in
      the world would she join their numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Melrose&rsquo;s face fell, and she looked at Susy with the plaintive
      bewilderment of the wielder of millions to whom everything that cannot be
      bought is imperceptible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t see why you can&rsquo;t change your plans,&rdquo; she murmured with a
      soft persistency.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well, you know&rdquo;&mdash;Susy paused on a slow inward smile&mdash;&ldquo;they&rsquo;re
      not mine only, as it happens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Melrose&rsquo;s brow clouded. The unforeseen complication of Mrs. Fulmer&rsquo;s
      presence on the journey had evidently tried her nerves, and this new
      obstacle to her arrangements shook her faith in the divine order of
      things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your plans are not yours only? But surely you won&rsquo;t let Ursula Gillow
      dictate to you?... There&rsquo;s my jade pendant; the one you said you liked the
      other day.... The Fulmers won&rsquo;t go with me, you understand, unless they&rsquo;re
      satisfied about the children; the whole plan will fall through. Susy
      darling, you were always too unselfish; I hate to see you sacrificed to
      Ursula.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susy&rsquo;s smile lingered. Time was when she might have been glad to add the
      jade pendant to the collection already enriched by Ellie Vanderlyn&rsquo;s
      sapphires; more recently, she would have resented the offer as an insult
      to her newly-found principles. But already the mere fact that she might
      henceforth, if she chose, be utterly out of reach of such bribes, enabled
      her to look down on them with tolerance. Oh, the blessed moral freedom
      that wealth conferred! She recalled Mrs. Fulmer&rsquo;s uncontrollable cry: &ldquo;The
      most wonderful thing of all is not having to contrive and skimp, and give
      up something every single minute!&rdquo; Yes; it was only on such terms that one
      could call one&rsquo;s soul one&rsquo;s own. The sense of it gave Susy the grace to
      answer amicably: &ldquo;If I could possibly help you out, Violet, I shouldn&rsquo;t
      want a present to persuade me. And, as you say, there&rsquo;s no reason why I
      should sacrifice myself to Ursula&mdash;or to anybody else. Only, as it
      happens&rdquo;&mdash;she paused and took the plunge&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to England
      because I&rsquo;ve promised to see a friend.&rdquo; That night she wrote to Strefford.
    </p>


<h3>XVI.</h3>

    <p>
      <span class="smcap">Stretched</span> out under an awning on the deck of the Ibis, Nick Lansing looked
      up for a moment at the vanishing cliffs of Malta and then plunged again
      into his book.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had had nearly three weeks of drug-taking on the Ibis. The drugs he had
      absorbed were of two kinds: visions of fleeing landscapes, looming up from
      the blue sea to vanish into it again, and visions of study absorbed from
      the volumes piled up day and night at his elbow. For the first time in
      months he was in reach of a real library, just the kind of scholarly yet
      miscellaneous library, that his restless and impatient spirit craved. He
      was aware that the books he read, like the fugitive scenes on which he
      gazed, were merely a form of anesthetic: he swallowed them with the
      careless greed of the sufferer who seeks only to still pain and deaden
      memory. But they were beginning to produce in him a moral languor that was
      not disagreeable, that, indeed, compared with the fierce pain of the first
      days, was almost pleasurable. It was exactly the kind of drug that he
      needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is probably no point on which the average man has more definite
      views than on the uselessness of writing a letter that is hard to write.
      In the line he had sent to Susy from Genoa Nick had told her that she
      would hear from him again in a few days; but when the few days had passed,
      and he began to consider setting himself to the task, he found fifty
      reasons for postponing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had there been any practical questions to write about it would have been
      different; he could not have borne for twenty-four hours the idea that she
      was in uncertainty as to money. But that had all been settled long ago.
      From the first she had had the administering of their modest fortune. On
      their marriage Nick&rsquo;s own meagre income, paid in, none too regularly, by
      the agent who had managed for years the dwindling family properties, had
      been transferred to her: it was the only wedding present he could make.
      And the wedding cheques had of course all been deposited in her name.
      There were therefore no &ldquo;business&rdquo; reasons for communicating with her; and
      when it came to reasons of another order the mere thought of them benumbed
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first few days he reproached himself for his inertia; then he
      began to seek reasons for justifying it. After all, for both their sakes a
      waiting policy might be the wisest he could pursue. He had left Susy
      because he could not tolerate the conditions on which he had discovered
      their life together to be based; and he had told her so. What more was
      there to say?
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing was changed in their respective situations; if they came together
      it could be only to resume the same life; and that, as the days went by,
      seemed to him more and more impossible. He had not yet reached the point
      of facing a definite separation; but whenever his thoughts travelled back
      over their past life he recoiled from any attempt to return to it. As long
      as this state of mind continued there seemed nothing to add to the letter
      he had already written, except indeed the statement that he was cruising
      with the Hickses. And he saw no pressing reason for communicating that.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the Hickses he had given no hint of his situation. When Coral Hicks, a
      fortnight earlier, had picked him up in the broiling streets of Genoa, and
      carried him off to the Ibis, he had thought only of a cool dinner and
      perhaps a moonlight sail. Then, in reply to their friendly urging, he had
      confessed that he had not been well&mdash;had indeed gone off hurriedly
      for a few days&rsquo; change of air&mdash;and that left him without defence
      against the immediate proposal that he should take his change of air on
      the Ibis. They were just off to Corsica and Sardinia, and from there to
      Sicily: he could rejoin the railway at Naples, and be back at Venice in
      ten days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten days of respite&mdash;the temptation was irresistible. And he really
      liked the kind uncomplicated Hickses. A wholesome honesty and simplicity
      breathed through all their opulence, as if the rich trappings of their
      present life still exhaled the fragrance of their native prairies. The
      mere fact of being with such people was like a purifying bath. When the
      yacht touched at Naples he agreed since they were so awfully kind&mdash;to
      go on to Sicily. And when the chief steward, going ashore at Naples for
      the last time before they got up steam, said: &ldquo;Any letters for the post,
      sir?&rdquo; he answered, as he had answered at each previous halt: &ldquo;No, thank
      you: none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now they were heading for Rhodes and Crete&mdash;Crete, where he had never
      been, where he had so often longed to go. In spite of the lateness of the
      season the weather was still miraculously fine: the short waves danced
      ahead under a sky without a cloud, and the strong bows of the Ibis hardly
      swayed as she flew forward over the flying crests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only his hosts and their daughter were on the yacht&mdash;of course with
      Eldorada Tooker and Mr. Beck in attendance. An eminent archaeologist, who
      was to have joined them at Naples, had telegraphed an excuse at the last
      moment; and Nick noticed that, while Mrs. Hicks was perpetually
      apologizing for the great man&rsquo;s absence, Coral merely smiled and said
      nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact, Mr. and Mrs. Hicks were never as pleasant as when one
      had them to one&rsquo;s self. In company, Mr. Hicks ran the risk of appearing
      over-hospitable, and Mrs. Hicks confused dates and names in the desire to
      embrace all culture in her conversation. But alone with Nick, their old
      travelling-companion, they shone out in their native simplicity, and Mr.
      Hicks talked soundly of investments, and Mrs. Hicks recalled her early
      married days in Apex City, when, on being brought home to her new house in
      Aeschylus Avenue, her first thought had been: &ldquo;How on earth shall I get
      all those windows washed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The loss of Mr. Buttles had been as serious to them as Nick had supposed:
      Mr. Beck could never hope to replace him. Apart from his mysterious gift
      of languages, and his almost superhuman faculty for knowing how to address
      letters to eminent people, and in what terms to conclude them, he had a
      smattering of archaeology and general culture on which Mrs. Hicks had
      learned to depend&mdash;her own memory being, alas, so inadequate to the
      range of her interests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her daughter might perhaps have helped her; but it was not Miss Hicks&rsquo;s
      way to mother her parents. She was exceedingly kind to them, but left
      them, as it were, to bring themselves up as best they could, while she
      pursued her own course of self-development. A sombre zeal for knowledge
      filled the mind of this strange girl: she appeared interested only in
      fresh opportunities of adding to her store of facts. They were illuminated
      by little imagination and less poetry; but, carefully catalogued and
      neatly sorted in her large cool brain, they were always as accessible as
      the volumes in an up-to-date public library.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Nick there was something reposeful in this lucid intellectual
      curiosity. He wanted above all things to get away from sentiment, from
      seduction, from the moods and impulses and flashing contradictions that
      were Susy. Susy was not a great reader: her store of facts was small, and
      she had grown up among people who dreaded ideas as much as if they had
      been a contagious disease. But, in the early days especially, when Nick
      had put a book in her hand, or read a poem to her, her swift intelligence
      had instantly shed a new light on the subject, and, penetrating to its
      depths, had extracted from them whatever belonged to her. What a pity that
      this exquisite insight, this intuitive discrimination, should for the most
      part have been spent upon reading the thoughts of vulgar people, and
      extracting a profit from them&mdash;should have been wasted, since her
      childhood, on all the hideous intricacies of &ldquo;managing&rdquo;!
    </p>
    <p>
      And visible beauty&mdash;how she cared for that too! He had not guessed
      it, or rather he had not been sure of it, till the day when, on their way
      through Paris, he had taken her to the Louvre, and they had stood before
      the little Crucifixion of Mantegna. He had not been looking at the
      picture, or watching to see what impression it produced on Susy. His own
      momentary mood was for Correggio and Fragonard, the laughter of the Music
      Lesson and the bold pagan joys of the Antiope; and then he had missed her
      from his side, and when he came to where she stood, forgetting him,
      forgetting everything, had seen the glare of that tragic sky in her face,
      her trembling lip, the tears on her lashes. That was Susy....
    </p>
    <p>
      Closing his book he stole a glance at Coral Hicks&rsquo;s profile, thrown back
      against the cushions of the deck-chair at his side. There was something
      harsh and bracing in her blunt primitive build, in the projection of the
      black eyebrows that nearly met over her thick straight nose, and the faint
      barely visible black down on her upper lip. Some miracle of will-power,
      combined with all the artifices that wealth can buy, had turned the fat
      sallow girl he remembered into this commanding young woman, almost
      handsome at times indisputably handsome&mdash;in her big authoritative
      way. Watching the arrogant lines of her profile against the blue sea, he
      remembered, with a thrill that was sweet to his vanity, how twice&mdash;under
      the dome of the Scalzi and in the streets of Genoa&mdash;he had seen those
      same lines soften at his approach, turn womanly, pleading and almost
      humble. That was Coral....
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she said, without turning toward him: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had no letters
      since you&rsquo;ve been on board.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her, surprised. &ldquo;No&mdash;thank the Lord!&rdquo; he laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you haven&rsquo;t written one either,&rdquo; she continued in her hard
      statistical tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he again agreed, with the same laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That means that you really are free&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Free?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He saw the cheek nearest him redden. &ldquo;Really off on a holiday, I mean; not
      tied down.&rdquo; After a pause he rejoined: &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not particularly tied
      down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your book?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my book&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped and considered. He had thrust The Pageant
      of Alexander into his handbag on the night of his Bight from Venice; but
      since then he had never looked at it. Too many memories and illusions were
      pressed between its pages; and he knew just at what page he had felt Ellie
      Vanderlyn bending over him from behind, caught a whiff of her scent, and
      heard her breathless &ldquo;I had to thank you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My book&rsquo;s hung up,&rdquo; he said impatiently, annoyed with Miss Hicks&rsquo;s lack
      of tact. There was a girl who never put out feelers....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I thought it was,&rdquo; she went on quietly, and he gave her a startled
      glance. What the devil else did she think, he wondered? He had never
      supposed her capable of getting far enough out of her own thick carapace
      of self-sufficiency to penetrate into any one else&rsquo;s feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The truth is,&rdquo; he continued, embarrassed, &ldquo;I suppose I dug away at it
      rather too continuously; that&rsquo;s probably why I felt the need of a change.
      You see I&rsquo;m only a beginner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She still continued her relentless questioning. &ldquo;But later&mdash;you&rsquo;ll go
      on with it, of course?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; He paused, glanced down the glittering deck, and then
      out across the glittering water. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been dreaming dreams, you see. I
      rather think I shall have to drop the book altogether, and try to look out
      for a job that will pay. To indulge in my kind of literature one must
      first have an assured income.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was instantly annoyed with himself for having spoken. Hitherto in his
      relations with the Hickses he had carefully avoided the least allusion
      that might make him feel the heavy hand of their beneficence. But the idle
      procrastinating weeks had weakened him and he had yielded to the need of
      putting into words his vague intentions. To do so would perhaps help to
      make them more definite.
    </p>
    <p>
      To his relief Miss Hicks made no immediate reply; and when she spoke it
      was in a softer voice and with an unwonted hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems a shame that with gifts like yours you shouldn&rsquo;t find some kind
      of employment that would leave you leisure enough to do your real
      work....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shrugged ironically. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;there are a goodish number of us
      hunting for that particular kind of employment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her tone became more business-like. &ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s hard to find&mdash;almost
      impossible. But would you take it, I wonder, if it were offered to you&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned her head slightly, and their eyes met. For an instant blank
      terror loomed upon him; but before he had time to face it she continued,
      in the same untroubled voice: &ldquo;Mr. Buttles&rsquo;s place, I mean. My parents
      must absolutely have some one they can count on. You know what an easy
      place it is.... I think you would find the salary satisfactory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nick drew a deep breath of relief. For a moment her eyes had looked as
      they had in the Scalzi&mdash;and he liked the girl too much not to shrink
      from reawakening that look. But Mr. Buttles&rsquo;s place: why not?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Buttles!&rdquo; he murmured, to gain time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you won&rsquo;t find the same reasons as he did for throwing up
      the job. He was the martyr of his artistic convictions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at her sideways, wondering. After all she did not know of his
      meeting with Mr. Buttles in Genoa, nor of the latter&rsquo;s confidences;
      perhaps she did not even know of Mr. Buttles&rsquo;s hopeless passion. At any
      rate her face remained calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not consider it&mdash;at least just for a few months? Till after our
      expedition to Mesopotamia?&rdquo; she pressed on, a little breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re awfully kind: but I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stood up with one of her abrupt movements. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t, all at once.
      Take time think it over. Father wanted me to ask you,&rdquo; she appended.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt the inadequacy of his response. &ldquo;It tempts me awfully, of course.
      But I must wait, at any rate&mdash;wait for letters. The fact is I shall
      have to wire from Rhodes to have them sent. I had chucked everything, even
      letters, for a few weeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you are tired,&rdquo; she murmured, giving him a last downward glance as
      she turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Rhodes Nick Lansing telegraphed to his Paris bank to send his letters
      to Candia; but when the Ibis reached Candia, and the mail was brought on
      board, the thick envelope handed to him contained no letter from Susy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why should it, since he had not yet written to her?
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not written, no: but in sending his address to the bank he knew he
      had given her the opportunity of reaching him if she wished to. And she
      had made no sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late that afternoon, when they returned to the yacht from their first
      expedition, a packet of newspapers lay on the deck-house table. Nick
      picked up one of the London journals, and his eye ran absently down the
      list of social events.
    </p>
    <p>
      He read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Among the visitors expected next week at Ruan Castle (let for the season
      to Mr. Frederick J. Gillow of New York) are Prince Altineri of Rome, the
      Earl of Altringham and Mrs. Nicholas Lansing, who arrived in London last
      week from Paris.&rdquo; Nick threw down the paper. It was just a month since he
      had left the Palazzo Vanderlyn and flung himself into the night express
      for Milan. A whole month&mdash;and Susy had not written. Only a month&mdash;and
      Susy and Strefford were already together!
    </p>


<h3>XVII.</h3>

    <p>
      <span class="smcap">Susy</span> had decided to wait for Strefford in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new Lord Altringham was with his family in the north, and though she
      found a telegram on arriving, saying that he would join her in town the
      following week, she had still an interval of several days to fill.
    </p>
    <p>
      London was a desert; the rain fell without ceasing, and alone in the
      shabby family hotel which, even out of season, was the best she could
      afford, she sat at last face to face with herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the moment when Violet Melrose had failed to carry out her plan for
      the Fulmer children her interest in Susy had visibly waned. Often before,
      in the old days, Susy Branch had felt the same abrupt change of
      temperature in the manner of the hostess of the moment; and often&mdash;how
      often&mdash;had yielded, and performed the required service, rather than
      risk the consequences of estrangement. To that, at least, thank heaven,
      she need never stoop again.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as she hurriedly packed her trunks at Versailles, scraped together an
      adequate tip for Mrs. Match, and bade good-bye to Violet (grown suddenly
      fond and demonstrative as she saw her visitor safely headed for the
      station)&mdash;as Susy went through the old familiar mummery of the
      enforced leave-taking, there rose in her so deep a disgust for the life of
      makeshifts and accommodations, that if at that moment Nick had reappeared
      and held out his arms to her, she was not sure she would have had the
      courage to return to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her London solitude the thirst for independence grew fiercer.
      Independence with ease, of course. Oh, her hateful useless love of
      beauty... the curse it had always been to her, the blessing it might have
      been if only she had had the material means to gratify and to express it!
      And instead, it only gave her a morbid loathing of that hideous hotel
      bedroom drowned in yellow rain-light, of the smell of soot and cabbage
      through the window, the blistered wall-paper, the dusty wax bouquets under
      glass globes, and the electric lighting so contrived that as you turned on
      the feeble globe hanging from the middle of the ceiling the feebler one
      beside the bed went out!
    </p>
    <p>
      What a sham world she and Nick had lived in during their few months
      together! What right had either of them to those exquisite settings of the
      life of leisure: the long white house hidden in camellias and cypresses
      above the lake, or the great rooms on the Giudecca with the shimmer of the
      canal always playing over their frescoed ceilings! Yet she had come to
      imagine that these places really belonged to them, that they would always
      go on living, fondly and irreproachably, in the frame of other people&rsquo;s
      wealth.... That, again, was the curse of her love of beauty, the way she
      always took to it as if it belonged to her!
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, the awakening was bound to come, and it was perhaps better that it
      should have come so soon. At any rate there was no use in letting her
      thoughts wander back to that shattered fool&rsquo;s paradise of theirs. Only, as
      she sat there and reckoned up the days till Strefford arrived, what else
      in the world was there to think of?
    </p>
    <p>
      Her future and his?
    </p>
    <p>
      But she knew that future by heart already! She had not spent her life
      among the rich and fashionable without having learned every detail of the
      trappings of a rich and fashionable marriage. She had calculated long ago
      just how many dinner-dresses, how many tea-gowns and how much lacy
      lingerie would go to make up the outfit of the future Countess of
      Altringham. She had even decided to which dressmaker she would go for her
      chinchilla cloak&mdash;for she meant to have one, and down to her feet, and
      softer and more voluminous and more extravagantly sumptuous than Violet&rsquo;s
      or Ursula&rsquo;s... not to speak of silver foxes and sables... nor yet of the
      Altringham jewels.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew all this by heart; had always known it. It all belonged to the
      make-up of the life of elegance: there was nothing new about it. What had
      been new to her was just that short interval with Nick&mdash;a life unreal
      indeed in its setting, but so real in its essentials: the one reality she
      had ever known. As she looked back on it she saw how much it had given her
      besides the golden flush of her happiness, the sudden flowering of
      sensuous joy in heart and body. Yes&mdash;there had been the flowering
      too, in pain like birth-pangs, of something graver, stronger, fuller of
      future power, something she had hardly heeded in her first light rapture,
      but that always came back and possessed her stilled soul when the rapture
      sank: the deep disquieting sense of something that Nick and love had
      taught her, but that reached out even beyond love and beyond Nick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her nerves were racked by the ceaseless swish, swish of the rain on the
      dirty panes and the smell of cabbage and coal that came in under the door
      when she shut the window. This nauseating foretaste of the luncheon she
      must presently go down to was more than she could bear. It brought with it
      a vision of the dank coffee-room below, the sooty Smyrna rug, the rain on
      the sky-light, the listless waitresses handing about food that tasted as
      if it had been rained on too. There was really no reason why she should
      let such material miseries add to her depression....
    </p>
    <p>
      She sprang up, put on her hat and jacket, and calling for a taxi drove to
      the London branch of the Nouveau Luxe hotel. It was just one o&rsquo;clock and
      she was sure to pick up a luncheon, for though London was empty that great
      establishment was not. It never was. Along those sultry velvet-carpeted
      halls, in that great flowered and scented dining-room, there was always a
      come-and-go of rich aimless people, the busy people who, having nothing to
      do, perpetually pursue their inexorable task from one end of the earth to
      the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, the monotony of those faces&mdash;the faces one always knew, whether
      one knew the people they belonged to or not! A fresh disgust seized her at
      the sight of them: she wavered, and then turned and fled. But on the
      threshold a still more familiar figure met her: that of a lady in
      exaggerated pearls and sables, descending from an exaggerated motor, like
      the motors in magazine advertisements, the huge arks in which jewelled
      beauties and slender youths pause to gaze at snowpeaks from an Alpine
      summit.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Ursula Gillow&mdash;dear old Ursula, on her way to Scotland&mdash;and
      she and Susy fell on each other&rsquo;s necks. It appeared that Ursula, detained
      till the next evening by a dress-maker&rsquo;s delay, was also out of a job and
      killing time, and the two were soon smiling at each other over the
      exquisite preliminaries of a luncheon which the head-waiter had
      authoritatively asked Mrs. Gillow to &ldquo;leave to him, as usual.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ursula was in a good humour. It did not often happen; but when it did her
      benevolence knew no bounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like Mrs. Melrose, like all her tribe in fact, she was too much absorbed
      in her own affairs to give more than a passing thought to any one else&rsquo;s;
      but she was delighted at the meeting with Susy, as her wandering kind
      always were when they ran across fellow-wanderers, unless the meeting
      happened to interfere with choicer pleasures. Not to be alone was the
      urgent thing; and Ursula, who had been forty-eight hours alone in London,
      at once exacted from her friend a promise that they should spend the rest
      of the day together. But once the bargain struck her mind turned again to
      her own affairs, and she poured out her confidences to Susy over a
      succession of dishes that manifested the head-waiter&rsquo;s understanding of
      the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ursula&rsquo;s confidences were always the same, though they were usually about
      a different person. She demolished and rebuilt her sentimental life with
      the same frequency and impetuosity as that with which she changed her
      dress-makers, did over her drawing-rooms, ordered new motors, altered the
      mounting of her jewels, and generally renewed the setting of her life.
      Susy knew in advance what the tale would be; but to listen to it over
      perfect coffee, an amber-scented cigarette at her lips, was pleasanter
      than consuming cold mutton alone in a mouldy coffee-room. The contrast was
      so soothing that she even began to take a languid interest in her friend&rsquo;s
      narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      After luncheon they got into the motor together and began a systematic
      round of the West End shops: furriers, jewellers and dealers in old
      furniture. Nothing could be more unlike Violet Melrose&rsquo;s long hesitating
      sessions before the things she thought she wanted till the moment came to
      decide. Ursula pounced on silver foxes and old lacquer as promptly and
      decisively as on the objects of her surplus sentimentality: she knew at
      once what she wanted, and valued it more after it was hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now&mdash;I wonder if you couldn&rsquo;t help me choose a grand piano?&rdquo; she
      suggested, as the last antiquarian bowed them out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A piano?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes: for Ruan. I&rsquo;m sending one down for Grace Fulmer. She&rsquo;s coming to
      stay... did I tell you? I want people to hear her. I want her to get
      engagements in London. My dear, she&rsquo;s a Genius.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Genius&mdash;Grace!&rdquo; Susy gasped. &ldquo;I thought it was Nat....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nat&mdash;Nat Fulmer?&rdquo; Ursula laughed derisively. &ldquo;Ah, of course&mdash;you&rsquo;ve
      been staying with that silly Violet! The poor thing is off her head about
      Nat&mdash;it&rsquo;s really pitiful. Of course he has talent: I saw that long
      before Violet had ever heard of him. Why, on the opening day of the
      American Artists&rsquo; exhibition, last winter, I stopped short before his
      &lsquo;Spring Snow-Storm&rsquo; (which nobody else had noticed till that moment), and
      said to the Prince, who was with me: &lsquo;The man has talent.&rsquo; But genius&mdash;why,
      it&rsquo;s his wife who has genius! Have you never heard Grace play the violin?
      Poor Violet, as usual, is off on the wrong tack. I&rsquo;ve given Fulmer my
      garden-house to do&mdash;no doubt Violet told you&mdash;because I wanted
      to help him. But Grace is my discovery, and I&rsquo;m determined to make her
      known, and to have every one understand that she is the genius of the two.
      I&rsquo;ve told her she simply must come to Ruan, and bring the best
      accompanyist she can find. You know poor Nerone is dreadfully bored by
      sport, though of course he goes out with the guns. And if one didn&rsquo;t have
      a little art in the evening.... Oh, Susy, do you mean to tell me you don&rsquo;t
      know how to choose a piano? I thought you were so fond of music!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am fond of it; but without knowing anything about it&mdash;in the way
      we&rsquo;re all of us fond of the worthwhile things in our stupid set,&rdquo; she
      added to herself&mdash;since it was obviously useless to impart such
      reflections to Ursula.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But are you sure Grace is coming?&rdquo; she questioned aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite sure. Why shouldn&rsquo;t she? I wired to her yesterday. I&rsquo;m giving her a
      thousand dollars and all her expenses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not till they were having tea in a Piccadilly tea-room that Mrs.
      Gillow began to manifest some interest in her companion&rsquo;s plans. The
      thought of losing Susy became suddenly intolerable to her. The Prince, who
      did not see why he should be expected to linger in London out of season,
      was already at Ruan, and Ursula could not face the evening and the whole
      of the next day by herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what are you doing in town, darling, I don&rsquo;t remember if I&rsquo;ve asked
      you,&rdquo; she said, resting her firm elbows on the tea-table while she took a
      light from Susy&rsquo;s cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      Susy hesitated. She had foreseen that the time must soon come when she
      should have to give some account of herself; and why should she not begin
      by telling Ursula?
    </p>
    <p>
      But telling her what?
    </p>
    <p>
      Her silence appeared to strike Mrs. Gillow as a reproach, and she
      continued with compunction: &ldquo;And Nick? Nick&rsquo;s with you? How is he, I
      thought you and he still were in Venice with Ellie Vanderlyn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were, for a few weeks.&rdquo; She steadied her voice. &ldquo;It was delightful.
      But now we&rsquo;re both on our own again&mdash;for a while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gillow scrutinized her more searchingly. &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re alone here,
      then; quite alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes: Nick&rsquo;s cruising with some friends in the Mediterranean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ursula&rsquo;s shallow gaze deepened singularly. &ldquo;But, Susy darling, then if
      you&rsquo;re alone&mdash;and out of a job, just for the moment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susy smiled. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but if you are, darling, and you would come to Ruan! I know Fred
      asked you didn&rsquo;t he? And he told me that both you and Nick had refused. He
      was awfully huffed at your not coming; but I suppose that was because Nick
      had other plans. We couldn&rsquo;t have him now, because there&rsquo;s no room for
      another gun; but since he&rsquo;s not here, and you&rsquo;re free, why you know,
      dearest, don&rsquo;t you, how we&rsquo;d love to have you? Fred would be too glad&mdash;too
      outrageously glad&mdash;but you don&rsquo;t much mind Fred&rsquo;s love-making, do
      you? And you&rsquo;d be such a help to me&mdash;if that&rsquo;s any argument! With
      that big house full of men, and people flocking over every night to dine,
      and Fred caring only for sport, and Nerone simply loathing it and
      ridiculing it, and not a minute to myself to try to keep him in a good
      humour.... Oh, Susy darling, don&rsquo;t say no, but let me telephone at once
      for a place in the train to-morrow night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susy leaned back, letting the ash lengthen on her cigarette. How familiar,
      how hatefully familiar, was that old appeal! Ursula felt the pressing need
      of someone to flirt with Fred for a few weeks... and here was the very
      person she needed. Susy shivered at the thought. She had never really
      meant to go to Ruan. She had simply used the moor as a pretext when Violet
      Melrose had gently put her out of doors. Rather than do what Ursula asked
      she would borrow a few hundred pounds of Strefford, as he had suggested,
      and then look about for some temporary occupation until&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Until she became Lady Altringham? Well, perhaps. At any rate, she was not
      going back to slave for Ursula.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head with a faint smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry, Ursula: of course I
      want awfully to oblige you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gillow&rsquo;s gaze grew reproachful. &ldquo;I should have supposed you would,&rdquo;
       she murmured. Susy, meeting her eyes, looked into them down a long vista
      of favours bestowed, and perceived that Ursula was not the woman to forget
      on which side the obligation lay between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Susy hesitated: she remembered the weeks of ecstasy she had owed to the
      Gillows&rsquo; wedding cheque, and it hurt her to appear ungrateful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could, Ursula... but really... I&rsquo;m not free at the moment.&rdquo; She
      paused, and then took an abrupt decision. &ldquo;The fact is, I&rsquo;m waiting here
      to see Strefford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strefford&rsquo; Lord Altringham?&rdquo; Ursula stared. &ldquo;Ah, yes-I remember. You and
      he used to be great friends, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Her roving attention
      deepened.... But if Susy were waiting to see Lord Altringham&mdash;one of
      the richest men in England! Suddenly Ursula opened her gold-meshed bag and
      snatched a miniature diary from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But wait a moment&mdash;yes, it is next week! I knew it was next week
      he&rsquo;s coming to Ruan! But, you darling, that makes everything all right.
      You&rsquo;ll send him a wire at once, and come with me to-morrow, and meet him
      there instead of in this nasty sloppy desert.... Oh, Susy, if you knew how
      hard life is for me in Scotland between the Prince and Fred you couldn&rsquo;t
      possibly say no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susy still wavered; but, after all, if Strefford were really bound for
      Ruan, why not see him there, agreeably and at leisure, instead of spending
      a dreary day with him in roaming the wet London streets, or screaming at
      him through the rattle of a restaurant orchestra? She knew he would not be
      likely to postpone his visit to Ruan in order to linger in London with
      her: such concessions had never been his way, and were less than ever
      likely to be, now that he could do so thoroughly and completely as he
      pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time she fully understood how different his destiny had
      become. Now of course all his days and hours were mapped out in advance:
      invitations assailed him, opportunities pressed on him, he had only to
      choose.... And the women! She had never before thought of the women. All
      the girls in England would be wanting to marry him, not to mention her own
      enterprising compatriots. And there were the married women, who were even
      more to be feared. Streff might, for the time, escape marriage; though she
      could guess the power of persuasion, family pressure, all the converging
      traditional influences he had so often ridiculed, yet, as she knew, had
      never completely thrown off.... Yes, those quiet invisible women at
      Altringham&mdash;his uncle&rsquo;s widow, his mother, the spinster sisters&mdash;it
      was not impossible that, with tact and patience&mdash;and the stupidest
      women could be tactful and patient on such occasions&mdash;they might
      eventually persuade him that it was his duty, they might put just the
      right young loveliness in his way.... But meanwhile, now, at once, there
      were the married women. Ah, they wouldn&rsquo;t wait, they were doubtless laying
      their traps already! Susy shivered at the thought. She knew too much about
      the way the trick was done, had followed, too often, all the sinuosities
      of such approaches. Not that they were very sinuous nowadays: more often
      there was just a swoop and a pounce when the time came; but she knew all
      the arts and the wiles that led up to it. She knew them, oh, how she knew
      them&mdash;though with Streff, thank heaven, she had never been called
      upon to exercise them! His love was there for the asking: would she not be
      a fool to refuse it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps; though on that point her mind still wavered. But at any rate she
      saw that, decidedly, it would be better to yield to Ursula&rsquo;s pressure;
      better to meet him at Ruan, in a congenial setting, where she would have
      time to get her bearings, observe what dangers threatened him, and make up
      her mind whether, after all, it was to be her mission to save him from the
      other women.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you like, then, Ursula....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you angel, you! I&rsquo;m so glad! We&rsquo;ll go to the nearest post office, and
      send off the wire ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As they got into the motor Mrs. Gillow seized Susy&rsquo;s arm with a pleading
      pressure. &ldquo;And you will let Fred make love to you a little, won&rsquo;t you,
      darling?&rdquo;
     </p>


<h3>XVIII.</h3>

    <p>
      &ldquo;<span class="smcap">But</span> I can&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; said Ellie Vanderlyn earnestly, &ldquo;why you don&rsquo;t
      announce your engagement before waiting for your divorce. People are
      beginning to do it, I assure you&mdash;it&rsquo;s so much safer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Vanderlyn, on the way back from St. Moritz to England, had paused in
      Paris to renew the depleted wardrobe which, only two months earlier, had
      filled so many trunks to bursting. Other ladies, flocking there from all
      points of the globe for the same purpose, disputed with her the Louis XVI
      suites of the Nouveau Luxe, the pink-candled tables in the restaurant, the
      hours for trying-on at the dressmakers&rsquo;; and just because they were so
      many, and all feverishly fighting to get the same things at the same time,
      they were all excited, happy and at ease. It was the most momentous period
      of the year: the height of the &ldquo;dress makers&rsquo; season.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Vanderlyn had run across Susy Lansing at one of the Rue de la Paix
      openings, where rows of ladies wan with heat and emotion sat for hours in
      rapt attention while spectral apparitions in incredible raiment tottered
      endlessly past them on aching feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Distracted from the regal splendours of a chinchilla cloak by the sense
      that another lady was also examining it, Mrs. Vanderlyn turned in surprise
      at sight of Susy, whose head was critically bent above the fur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Susy! I&rsquo;d no idea you were here! I saw in the papers that you were with
      the Gillows.&rdquo; The customary embraces followed; then Mrs. Vanderlyn, her
      eyes pursuing the matchless cloak as it disappeared down a vista of
      receding mannequins, interrogated sharply: &ldquo;Are you shopping for Ursula?
      If you mean to order that cloak for her I&rsquo;d rather know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susy smiled, and paused a moment before answering. During the pause she
      took in all the exquisite details of Ellie Vanderlyn&rsquo;s perpetually
      youthful person, from the plumed crown of her head to the perfect arch of
      her patent-leather shoes. At last she said quietly: &ldquo;No&mdash;to-day I&rsquo;m
      shopping for myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yourself? Yourself?&rdquo; Mrs. Vanderlyn echoed with a stare of incredulity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; just for a change,&rdquo; Susy serenely acknowledged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the cloak&mdash;I meant the chinchilla cloak... the one with the
      ermine lining....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; it is awfully good, isn&rsquo;t it? But I mean to look elsewhere before I
      decide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ah, how often she had heard her friends use that phrase; and how amusing
      it was, now, to see Ellie&rsquo;s amazement as she heard it tossed off in her
      own tone of contemptuous satiety! Susy was becoming more and more
      dependent on such diversions; without them her days, crowded as they were,
      would nevertheless have dragged by heavily. But it still amused her to go
      to the big dressmakers&rsquo;, watch the mannequins sweep by, and be seen by her
      friends superciliously examining all the most expensive dresses in the
      procession. She knew the rumour was abroad that she and Nick were to be
      divorced, and that Lord Altringham was &ldquo;devoted&rdquo; to her. She neither
      confirmed nor denied the report: she just let herself be luxuriously
      carried forward on its easy tide. But although it was now three months
      since Nick had left the Palazzo Vanderlyn she had not yet written to him&mdash;nor
      he to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, in spite of all that she packed into them, the days passed more
      and more slowly, and the excitements she had counted on no longer excited
      her. Strefford was hers: she knew that he would marry her as soon as she
      was free. They had been together at Ruan for ten days, and after that she
      had motored south with him, stopping on the way to see Altringham, from
      which, at the moment, his mourning relatives were absent.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Altringham they had parted; and after one or two more visits in England
      she had come back to Paris, where he was now about to join her. After her
      few hours at Altringham she had understood that he would wait for her as
      long as was necessary: the fear of the &ldquo;other women&rdquo; had ceased to trouble
      her. But, perhaps for that very reason, the future seemed less exciting
      than she had expected. Sometimes she thought it was the sight of that
      great house which had overwhelmed her: it was too vast, too venerable, too
      like a huge monument built of ancient territorial traditions and
      obligations. Perhaps it had been lived in for too long by too many
      serious-minded and conscientious women: somehow she could not picture it
      invaded by bridge and debts and adultery. And yet that was what would have
      to be, of course... she could hardly picture either Strefford or herself
      continuing there the life of heavy county responsibilities, dull parties,
      laborious duties, weekly church-going, and presiding over local
      committees.... What a pity they couldn&rsquo;t sell it and have a little house
      on the Thames!
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless she was not sorry to let it be known that Altringham was hers
      when she chose to take it. At times she wondered whether Nick knew...
      whether rumours had reached him. If they had, he had only his own letter
      to thank for it. He had told her what course to pursue; and she was
      pursuing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment the meeting with Ellie Vanderlyn had been a shock to her; she
      had hoped never to see Ellie again. But now that they were actually face
      to face Susy perceived how dulled her sensibilities were. In a few moments
      she had grown used to Ellie, as she was growing used to everybody and to
      everything in the old life she had returned to. What was the use of making
      such a fuss about things? She and Mrs. Vanderlyn left the dress-maker&rsquo;s
      together, and after an absorbing session at a new milliner&rsquo;s were now
      taking tea in Ellie&rsquo;s drawing-room at the Nouveau Luxe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ellie, with her spoiled child&rsquo;s persistency, had come back to the question
      of the chinchilla cloak. It was the only one she had seen that she fancied
      in the very least, and as she hadn&rsquo;t a decent fur garment left to her name
      she was naturally in somewhat of a hurry... but, of course, if Susy had
      been choosing that model for a friend....
    </p>
    <p>
      Susy, leaning back against her cushions, examined through half-closed lids
      Mrs. Vanderlyn&rsquo;s small delicately-restored countenance, which wore the
      same expression of childish eagerness as when she discoursed of the young
      Davenant of the moment. Once again Susy remarked that, in Ellie&rsquo;s agitated
      existence, every interest appeared to be on exactly the same plane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poor shivering dear,&rdquo; she answered laughing, &ldquo;of course it shall have
      its nice warm winter cloak, and I&rsquo;ll choose another one instead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you darling, you! If you would! Of course, whoever you were ordering
      it for need never know....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you can&rsquo;t comfort yourself with that, I&rsquo;m afraid. I&rsquo;ve already told
      you that I was ordering it for myself.&rdquo; Susy paused to savour to the full
      Ellie&rsquo;s look of blank bewilderment; then her amusement was checked by an
      indefinable change in her friend&rsquo;s expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dearest&mdash;seriously? I didn&rsquo;t know there was someone....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susy flushed to the forehead. A horror of humiliation overwhelmed her.
      That Ellie should dare to think that of her&mdash;that anyone should dare
      to!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Someone buying chinchilla cloaks for me? Thanks!&rdquo; she flared out. &ldquo;I
      suppose I ought to be glad that the idea didn&rsquo;t immediately occur to you.
      At least there was a decent interval of doubt....&rdquo; She stood up, laughing
      again, and began to wander about the room. In the mirror above the mantel
      she caught sight of her flushed angry face, and of Mrs. Vanderlyn&rsquo;s
      disconcerted stare. She turned toward her friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose everybody else will think it if you do; so perhaps I&rsquo;d better
      explain.&rdquo; She paused, and drew a quick breath. &ldquo;Nick and I mean to part&mdash;have
      parted, in fact. He&rsquo;s decided that the whole thing was a mistake. He will
      probably; marry again soon&mdash;and so shall I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She flung the avowal out breathlessly, in her nervous dread of letting
      Ellie Vanderlyn think for an instant longer that any other explanation was
      conceivable. She had not meant to be so explicit; but once the words were
      spoken she was not altogether sorry. Of course people would soon begin to
      wonder why she was again straying about the world alone; and since it was
      by Nick&rsquo;s choice, why should she not say so? Remembering the burning
      anguish of those last hours in Venice she asked herself what possible
      consideration she owed to the man who had so humbled her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ellie Vanderlyn glanced at her in astonishment. &ldquo;You? You and Nick&mdash;are
      going to part?&rdquo; A light appeared to dawn on her. &ldquo;Ah&mdash;then that&rsquo;s why
      he sent me back my pin, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your pin?&rdquo; Susy wondered, not at once remembering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poor little scarf-pin I gave him before I left Venice. He sent it
      back almost at once, with the oddest note&mdash;just: &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t earned
      it, really.&rsquo; I couldn&rsquo;t think why he didn&rsquo;t care for the pin. But, now I
      suppose it was because you and he had quarrelled; though really, even so,
      I can&rsquo;t see why he should bear me a grudge....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susy&rsquo;s quick blood surged up. Nick had sent back the pin&mdash;the fatal pin!
      And she, Susy, had kept the bracelet&mdash;locked it up out of sight,
      shrunk away from the little packet whenever her hand touched it in packing
      or unpacking&mdash;but never thought of returning it, no, not once! Which
      of the two, she wondered, had been right? Was it not an indirect slight to
      her that Nick should fling back the gift to poor uncomprehending Ellie? Or
      was it not rather another proof of his finer moral sensitiveness!... And
      how could one tell, in their bewildering world, &ldquo;It was not because we&rsquo;ve
      quarrelled; we haven&rsquo;t quarrelled,&rdquo; she said slowly, moved by the sudden
      desire to defend her privacy and Nick&rsquo;s, to screen from every eye their
      last bitter hour together. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve simply decided that our experiment was
      impossible&mdash;for two paupers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well&mdash;of course we all felt that at the time. And now somebody
      else wants to marry you! And it&rsquo;s your trousseau you were choosing that
      cloak for?&rdquo; Ellie cried in incredulous rapture; then she flung her arms
      about Susy&rsquo;s shrinking shoulders. &ldquo;You lucky lucky girl! You clever clever
      darling! But who on earth can he be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And it was then that Susy, for the first time, had pronounced the name of
      Lord Altringham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Streff&mdash;Streff? Our dear old Streff, You mean to say he wants to
      marry you?&rdquo; As the news took possession of her mind Ellie became
      dithyrambic. &ldquo;But, my dearest, what a miracle of luck! Of course I always
      knew he was awfully gone on you: Fred Davenant used to say so, I
      remember... and even Nelson, who&rsquo;s so stupid about such things, noticed it
      in Venice.... But then it was so different. No one could possibly have
      thought of marrying him then; whereas now of course every woman is trying
      for him. Oh, Susy, whatever you do, don&rsquo;t miss your chance! You can&rsquo;t
      conceive of the wicked plotting and intriguing there will be to get him&mdash;on
      all sides, and even where one least suspects it. You don&rsquo;t know what
      horrors women will do&mdash;and even girls!&rdquo; A shudder ran through her at the
      thought, and she caught Susy&rsquo;s wrists in vehement fingers. &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t
      think, my dear, why you don&rsquo;t announce your engagement at once. People are
      beginning to do it, I assure you&mdash;it&rsquo;s so much safer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susy looked at her, wondering. Not a word of sympathy for the ruin of her
      brief bliss, not even a gleam of curiosity as to its cause! No doubt Ellie
      Vanderlyn, like all Susy&rsquo;s other friends, had long since &ldquo;discounted&rdquo; the
      brevity of her dream, and perhaps planned a sequel to it before she
      herself had seen the glory fading. She and Nick had spent the greater part
      of their few weeks together under Ellie Vanderlyn&rsquo;s roof; but to Ellie,
      obviously, the fact meant no more than her own escapade, at the same
      moment, with young Davenant&rsquo;s supplanter&mdash;the &ldquo;bounder&rdquo; whom
      Strefford had never named. Her one thought for her friend was that Susy
      should at last secure her prize&mdash;her incredible prize. And therein at
      any rate Ellie showed the kind of cold disinterestedness that raised her
      above the smiling perfidy of the majority of her kind. At least her advice
      was sincere; and perhaps it was wise. Why should Susy not let every one
      know that she meant to marry Strefford as soon as the &ldquo;formalities&rdquo; were
      fulfilled?
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not immediately answer Mrs. Vanderlyn&rsquo;s question; and the latter,
      repeating it, added impatiently: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you; if Nick agrees&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he agrees,&rdquo; said Susy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what more do you want! Oh, Susy, if you&rsquo;d only follow my example!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your example?&rdquo; Susy paused, weighed the word, was struck by something
      embarrassed, arch yet half-apologetic in her friend&rsquo;s expression. &ldquo;Your
      example?&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Why, Ellie, what on earth do you mean? Not that
      you&rsquo;re going to part from poor Nelson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Vanderlyn met her reproachful gaze with a crystalline glance. &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t want to, heaven knows&mdash;poor dear Nelson! I assure you I simply
      hate it. He&rsquo;s always such an angel to Clarissa... and then we&rsquo;re used to
      each other. But what in the world am I to do? Algie&rsquo;s so rich, so
      appallingly rich, that I have to be perpetually on the watch to keep other
      women away from him&mdash;and it&rsquo;s too exhausting....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Algie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Vanderlyn&rsquo;s lovely eyebrows rose. &ldquo;Algie: Algie Bockheimer. Didn&rsquo;t
      you know, I think he said you&rsquo;ve dined with his parents. Nobody else in
      the world is as rich as the Bockheimers; and Algie&rsquo;s their only child.
      Yes, it was with him... with him I was so dreadfully happy last spring...
      and now I&rsquo;m in mortal terror of losing him. And I do assure you there&rsquo;s no
      other way of keeping them, when they&rsquo;re as hideously rich as that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susy rose to her feet. A little shudder ran over her. She remembered, now,
      having seen Algie Bockheimer at one of his parents&rsquo; first entertainments,
      in their newly-inaugurated marble halls in Fifth Avenue. She recalled his
      too faultless clothes and his small glossy furtive countenance. She looked
      at Ellie Vanderlyn with sudden scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re abominable,&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other&rsquo;s perfect little face collapsed. &ldquo;A-bo-minable? A-bo-mi-nable?
      Susy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes... with Nelson... and Clarissa... and your past together... and all
      the money you can possibly want... and that man! Abominable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ellie stood up trembling: she was not used to scenes, and they disarranged
      her thoughts as much as her complexion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re very cruel, Susy&mdash;so cruel and dreadful that I hardly know
      how to answer you,&rdquo; she stammered. &ldquo;But you simply don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re
      talking about. As if anybody ever had all the money they wanted!&rdquo; She
      wiped her dark-rimmed eyes with a cautious handkerchief, glanced at
      herself in the mirror, and added magnanimously: &ldquo;But I shall try to forget
      what you&rsquo;ve said.&rdquo;
     </p>


<h3>XIX.</h3>

    <p>
      <span class="smcap">Just</span> such a revolt as she had felt as a girl, such a disgusted recoil from
      the standards and ideals of everybody about her as had flung her into her
      mad marriage with Nick, now flamed in Susy Lansing&rsquo;s bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      How could she ever go back into that world again? How echo its appraisals
      of life and bow down to its judgments? Alas, it was only by marrying
      according to its standards that she could escape such subjection. Perhaps
      the same thought had actuated Nick: perhaps he had understood sooner than
      she that to attain moral freedom they must both be above material cares.
      Perhaps...
    </p>
    <p>
      Her talk with Ellie Vanderlyn had left Susy so oppressed and humiliated
      that she almost shrank from her meeting with Altringham the next day. She
      knew that he was coming to Paris for his final answer; he would wait as
      long as was necessary if only she would consent to take immediate steps
      for a divorce. She was staying at a modest hotel in the Faubourg St.
      Germain, and had once more refused his suggestion that they should lunch
      at the Nouveau Luxe, or at some fashionable restaurant of the Boulevards.
      As before, she insisted on going to an out-of-the-way place near the
      Luxembourg, where the prices were moderate enough for her own purse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; Strefford objected, as they turned from her hotel
      door toward this obscure retreat, &ldquo;why you insist on giving me bad food,
      and depriving me of the satisfaction of being seen with you. Why must we
      be so dreadfully clandestine? Don&rsquo;t people know by this time that we&rsquo;re to
      be married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susy winced a little: she wondered if the word would always sound so
      unnatural on his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, with a laugh, &ldquo;they simply think, for the present, that
      you&rsquo;re giving me pearls and chinchilla cloaks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wrinkled his brows good-humouredly. &ldquo;Well, so I would, with joy&mdash;at
      this particular minute. Don&rsquo;t you think perhaps you&rsquo;d better take
      advantage of it? I don&rsquo;t wish to insist&mdash;but I foresee that I&rsquo;m much
      too rich not to become stingy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave a slight shrug. &ldquo;At present there&rsquo;s nothing I loathe more than
      pearls and chinchilla, or anything else in the world that&rsquo;s expensive and
      enviable....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she broke off, colouring with the consciousness that she had said
      exactly the kind of thing that all the women who were trying for him
      (except the very cleverest) would be sure to say; and that he would
      certainly suspect her of attempting the conventional comedy of
      disinterestedness, than which nothing was less likely to deceive or to
      flatter him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His twinkling eyes played curiously over her face, and she went on,
      meeting them with a smile: &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t imagine, all the same, that if I
      should... decide... it would be altogether for your beaux yeux....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed, she thought, rather drily. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose
      that&rsquo;s ever likely to happen to me again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Streff&mdash;&rdquo; she faltered with compunction. It was odd&mdash;once upon a
      time she had known exactly what to say to the man of the moment, whoever
      he was, and whatever kind of talk he required; she had even, in the
      difficult days before her marriage, reeled off glibly enough the sort of
      lime-light sentimentality that plunged poor Fred Gillow into such
      speechless beatitude. But since then she had spoken the language of real
      love, looked with its eyes, embraced with its hands; and now the other
      trumpery art had failed her, and she was conscious of bungling and groping
      like a beginner under Strefford&rsquo;s ironic scrutiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had reached their obscure destination and he opened the door and
      glanced in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s jammed&mdash;not a table. And stifling! Where shall we go? Perhaps
      they could give us a room to ourselves&mdash;&rdquo; he suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      She assented, and they were led up a cork-screw staircase to a
      squat-ceilinged closet lit by the arched top of a high window, the lower
      panes of which served for the floor below. Strefford opened the window,
      and Susy, throwing her cloak on the divan, leaned on the balcony while he
      ordered luncheon.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the whole she was glad they were to be alone. Just because she felt so
      sure of Strefford it seemed ungenerous to keep him longer in suspense. The
      moment had come when they must have a decisive talk, and in the crowded
      rooms below it would have been impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strefford, when the waiter had brought the first course and left them to
      themselves, made no effort to revert to personal matters. He turned
      instead to the topic always most congenial to him: the humours and ironies
      of the human comedy, as presented by his own particular group. His
      malicious commentary on life had always amused Susy because of the shrewd
      flashes of philosophy he shed on the social antics they had so often
      watched together. He was in fact the one person she knew (excepting Nick)
      who was in the show and yet outside of it; and she was surprised, as the
      talk proceeded, to find herself so little interested in his scraps of
      gossip, and so little amused by his comments on them.
    </p>
    <p>
      With an inward shrug of discouragement she said to herself that probably
      nothing would ever really amuse her again; then, as she listened, she
      began to understand that her disappointment arose from the fact that
      Strefford, in reality, could not live without these people whom he saw
      through and satirized, and that the rather commonplace scandals he
      narrated interested him as much as his own racy considerations on them;
      and she was filled with terror at the thought that the inmost core of the
      richly-decorated life of the Countess of Altringham would be just as poor
      and low-ceilinged a place as the little room in which he and she now sat,
      elbow to elbow yet so unapproachably apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Strefford could not live without these people, neither could she and
      Nick; but for reasons how different! And if his opportunities had been
      theirs, what a world they would have created for themselves! Such
      imaginings were vain, and she shrank back from them into the present.
      After all, as Lady Altringham she would have the power to create that
      world which she and Nick had dreamed... only she must create it alone.
      Well, that was probably the law of things. All human happiness was thus
      conditioned and circumscribed, and hers, no doubt, must always be of the
      lonely kind, since material things did not suffice for it, even though it
      depended on them as Grace Fulmer&rsquo;s, for instance, never had. Yet even
      Grace Fulmer had succumbed to Ursula&rsquo;s offer, and had arrived at Ruan the
      day before Susy left, instead of going to Spain with her husband and
      Violet Melrose. But then Grace was making the sacrifice for her children,
      and somehow one had the feeling that in giving up her liberty she was not
      surrendering a tittle of herself. All the difference was there....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How I do bore you!&rdquo; Susy heard Strefford exclaim. She became aware that
      she had not been listening: stray echoes of names of places and people&mdash;Violet
      Melrose, Ursula, Prince Altineri, others of their group and persuasion&mdash;had
      vainly knocked at her barricaded brain; what had he been telling her about
      them? She turned to him and their eyes met; his were full of a melancholy
      irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Susy, old girl, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pulled herself together. &ldquo;I was thinking, Streff, just now&mdash;when
      I said I hated the very sound of pearls and chinchilla&mdash;how
      impossible it was that you should believe me; in fact, what a blunder I&rsquo;d
      made in saying it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled. &ldquo;Because it was what so many other women might be likely to say
      so awfully unoriginal, in fact?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed for sheer joy at his insight. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be easier than I
      imagined,&rdquo; she thought. Aloud she rejoined: &ldquo;Oh, Streff&mdash;how you&rsquo;re
      always going to find me out! Where on earth shall I ever hide from you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo; He echoed her laugh, laying his hand lightly on hers. &ldquo;In my
      heart, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spite of the laugh his accent shook her: something about it took all
      the mockery from his retort, checked on her lips the: &ldquo;What? A valentine!&rdquo;
       and made her suddenly feel that, if he were afraid, so was she. Yet she
      was touched also, and wondered half exultingly if any other woman had ever
      caught that particular deep inflexion of his shrill voice. She had never
      liked him as much as at that moment; and she said to herself, with an odd
      sense of detachment, as if she had been rather breathlessly observing the
      vacillations of someone whom she longed to persuade but dared not: &ldquo;Now&mdash;NOW,
      if he speaks, I shall say yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not speak; but abruptly, and as startlingly to her as if she had
      just dropped from a sphere whose inhabitants had other methods of
      expressing their sympathy, he slipped his arm around her and bent his keen
      ugly melting face to hers....
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the lightest touch&mdash;in an instant she was free again. But
      something within her gasped and resisted long after his arm and his lips
      were gone, and he was proceeding, with a too-studied ease, to light a
      cigarette and sweeten his coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had kissed her.... Well, naturally: why not? It was not the first time
      she had been kissed. It was true that one didn&rsquo;t habitually associate
      Streff with such demonstrations; but she had not that excuse for surprise,
      for even in Venice she had begun to notice that he looked at her
      differently, and avoided her hand when he used to seek it.
    </p>
    <p>
      No&mdash;she ought not to have been surprised; nor ought a kiss to have
      been so disturbing. Such incidents had punctuated the career of Susy
      Branch: there had been, in particular, in far-off discarded times, Fred
      Gillow&rsquo;s large but artless embraces. Well&mdash;nothing of that kind had
      seemed of any more account than the click of a leaf in a woodland walk. It
      had all been merely epidermal, ephemeral, part of the trivial accepted
      &ldquo;business&rdquo; of the social comedy. But this kiss of Strefford&rsquo;s was what
      Nick&rsquo;s had been, under the New Hampshire pines, on the day that had
      decided their fate. It was a kiss with a future in it: like a ring slipped
      upon her soul. And now, in the dreadful pause that followed&mdash;while
      Strefford fidgeted with his cigarette-case and rattled the spoon in his
      cup, Susy remembered what she had seen through the circle of Nick&rsquo;s kiss:
      that blue illimitable distance which was at once the landscape at their
      feet and the future in their souls....
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps that was what Strefford&rsquo;s sharply narrowed eyes were seeing now,
      that same illimitable distance that she had lost forever&mdash;perhaps he
      was saying to himself, as she had said to herself when her lips left
      Nick&rsquo;s: &ldquo;Each time we kiss we shall see it all again....&rdquo; Whereas all she
      herself had felt was the gasping recoil from Strefford&rsquo;s touch, and an
      intenser vision of the sordid room in which he and she sat, and of their
      two selves, more distant from each other than if their embrace had been a
      sudden thrusting apart....
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment prolonged itself, and they sat numb. How long had it lasted?
      How long ago was it that she had thought: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be easier than I
      imagined&rdquo;? Suddenly she felt Strefford&rsquo;s queer smile upon her, and saw in
      his eyes a look, not of reproach or disappointment, but of deep and
      anxious comprehension. Instead of being angry or hurt, he had seen, he had
      understood, he was sorry for her!
    </p>
    <p>
      Impulsively she slipped her hand into his, and they sat silent for another
      moment. Then he stood up and took her cloak from the divan. &ldquo;Shall we go
      now! I&rsquo;ve got cards for the private view of the Reynolds exhibition at the
      Petit Palais. There are some portraits from Altringham. It might amuse
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the taxi she had time, through their light rattle of talk, to readjust
      herself and drop back into her usual feeling of friendly ease with him. He
      had been extraordinarily considerate, for anyone who always so
      undisguisedly sought his own satisfaction above all things; and if his
      considerateness were just an indirect way of seeking that satisfaction
      now, well, that proved how much he cared for her, how necessary to his
      happiness she had become. The sense of power was undeniably pleasant;
      pleasanter still was the feeling that someone really needed her, that the
      happiness of the man at her side depended on her yes or no. She abandoned
      herself to the feeling, forgetting the abysmal interval of his caress, or
      at least saying to herself that in time she would forget it, that really
      there was nothing to make a fuss about in being kissed by anyone she liked
      as much as Streff....
    </p>
    <p>
      She had guessed at once why he was taking her to see the Reynoldses.
      Fashionable and artistic Paris had recently discovered English eighteenth
      century art. The principal collections of England had yielded up their
      best examples of the great portrait painter&rsquo;s work, and the private view
      at the Petit Palais was to be the social event of the afternoon. Everybody&mdash;Strefford&rsquo;s
      everybody and Susy&rsquo;s&mdash;was sure to be there; and these, as she knew,
      were the occasions that revived Strefford&rsquo;s intermittent interest in art.
      He really liked picture shows as much as the races, if one could be sure
      of seeing as many people there. With Nick how different it would have
      been! Nick hated openings and varnishing days, and worldly aesthetics in
      general; he would have waited till the tide of fashion had ebbed, and
      slipped off with Susy to see the pictures some morning when they were sure
      to have the place to themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Susy divined that there was another reason for Strefford&rsquo;s suggestion.
      She had never yet shown herself with him publicly, among their own group
      of people: now he had determined that she should do so, and she knew why.
      She had humbled his pride; he had understood, and forgiven her. But she
      still continued to treat him as she had always treated the Strefford of
      old, Charlie Strefford, dear old negligible impecunious Streff; and he
      wanted to show her, ever so casually and adroitly, that the man who had
      asked her to marry him was no longer Strefford, but Lord Altringham.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the very threshold, his Ambassador&rsquo;s greeting marked the difference: it
      was followed, wherever they turned, by ejaculations of welcome from the
      rulers of the world they moved in. Everybody rich enough or titled enough,
      or clever enough or stupid enough, to have forced a way into the social
      citadel, was there, waving and flag-flying from the battlements; and to
      all of them Lord Altringham had become a marked figure. During their slow
      progress through the dense mass of important people who made the approach
      to the pictures so well worth fighting for, he never left Susy&rsquo;s side, or
      failed to make her feel herself a part of his triumphal advance. She heard
      her name mentioned: &ldquo;Lansing&mdash;a Mrs. Lansing&mdash;an American...
      Susy Lansing? Yes, of course.... You remember her? At Newport, At St.
      Moritz? Exactly.... Divorced already? They say so... Susy darling! I&rsquo;d no
      idea you were here... and Lord Altringham! You&rsquo;ve forgotten me, I know,
      Lord Altringham.... Yes, last year, in Cairo... or at Newport... or in
      Scotland ... Susy, dearest, when will you bring Lord Altringham to dine?
      Any night that you and he are free I&rsquo;ll arrange to be....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You and he&rdquo;: they were &ldquo;you and he&rdquo; already!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, there&rsquo;s one of them&mdash;of my great-grandmothers,&rdquo; Strefford
      explained, giving a last push that drew him and Susy to the front rank,
      before a tall isolated portrait which, by sheer majesty of presentment,
      sat in its great carved golden frame as on a throne above the other
      pictures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Susy read on the scroll beneath it: &ldquo;The Hon&rsquo;ble Diana Lefanu, fifteenth
      Countess of Altringham&rdquo;&mdash;and heard Strefford say: &ldquo;Do you remember?
      It hangs where you noticed the empty space above the mantel-piece, in the
      Vandyke room. They say Reynolds stipulated that it should be put with the
      Vandykes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had never before heard him speak of his possessions, whether ancestral
      or merely material, in just that full and satisfied tone of voice: the
      rich man&rsquo;s voice. She saw that he was already feeling the influence of his
      surroundings, that he was glad the portrait of a Countess of Altringham
      should occupy the central place in the principal room of the exhibition,
      that the crowd about it should be denser there than before any of the
      other pictures, and that he should be standing there with Susy, letting
      her feel, and letting all the people about them guess, that the day she
      chose she could wear the same name as his pictured ancestress.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the way back to her hotel, Strefford made no farther allusion to their
      future; they chatted like old comrades in their respective corners of the
      taxi. But as the carriage stopped at her door he said: &ldquo;I must go back to
      England the day after to-morrow, worse luck! Why not dine with me to-night
      at the Nouveau Luxe? I&rsquo;ve got to have the Ambassador and Lady Ascot, with
      their youngest girl and my old Dunes aunt, the Dowager Duchess, who&rsquo;s over
      here hiding from her creditors; but I&rsquo;ll try to get two or three amusing
      men to leaven the lump. We might go on to a boite afterward, if you&rsquo;re
      bored. Unless the dancing amuses you more....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She understood that he had decided to hasten his departure rather than
      linger on in uncertainty; she also remembered having heard the Ascots&rsquo;
      youngest daughter, Lady Joan Senechal, spoken of as one of the prettiest
      girls of the season; and she recalled the almost exaggerated warmth of the
      Ambassador&rsquo;s greeting at the private view.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;ll come, Streff dear!&rdquo; she cried, with an effort at gaiety
      that sounded successful to her own strained ears, and reflected itself in
      the sudden lighting up of his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      She waved a good-bye from the step, saying to herself, as she looked after
      him: &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll drive me home to-night, and I shall say &lsquo;yes&rsquo;; and then he&rsquo;ll
      kiss me again. But the next time it won&rsquo;t be nearly as disagreeable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned into the hotel, glanced automatically at the empty pigeon-hole
      for letters under her key-hook, and mounted the stairs following the same
      train of images. &ldquo;Yes, I shall say &lsquo;yes&rsquo; to-night,&rdquo; she repeated firmly,
      her hand on the door of her room. &ldquo;That is, unless, they&rsquo;ve brought up a
      letter....&rdquo; She never re-entered the hotel without imagining that the
      letter she had not found below had already been brought up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opening the door, she turned on the light and sprang to the table on which
      her correspondence sometimes awaited her.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no letter; but the morning papers, still unread, lay at hand,
      and glancing listlessly down the column which chronicles the doings of
      society, she read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After an extended cruise in the AEgean and the Black Sea on their
      steam-yacht Ibis, Mr. and Mrs. Mortimer Hicks and their daughter are
      established at the Nouveau Luxe in Rome. They have lately had the honour
      of entertaining at dinner the Reigning Prince of Teutoburger-Waldhain and
      his mother the Princess Dowager, with their suite. Among those invited to
      meet their Serene Highnesses were the French and Spanish Ambassadors, the
      Duchesse de Vichy, Prince and Princess Bagnidilucca, Lady Penelope
      Pantiles&mdash;&rdquo; Susy&rsquo;s eye flew impatiently on over the long list of
      titles&mdash;&ldquo;and Mr. Nicholas Lansing of New York, who has been cruising
      with Mr. and Mrs. Hicks on the Ibis for the last few months.&rdquo;
     </p>


<h3>XX.</h3>

    <p>
      <span class="smcap">The</span> Mortimer Hickses were in Rome; not, as they would in former times have
      been, in one of the antiquated hostelries of the Piazza di Spagna or the
      Porta del Popolo, where of old they had so gaily defied fever and
      nourished themselves on local colour; but spread out, with all the
      ostentation of philistine millionaires, under the piano nobile ceilings of
      one of the high-perched &ldquo;Palaces,&rdquo; where, as Mrs. Hicks shamelessly
      declared, they could &ldquo;rely on the plumbing,&rdquo; and &ldquo;have the privilege of
      over-looking the Queen Mother&rsquo;s Gardens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was that speech, uttered with beaming aplomb at a dinner-table
      surrounded by the cosmopolitan nobility of the Eternal City, that had
      suddenly revealed to Lansing the profound change in the Hicks point of
      view.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he looked back over the four months since he had so unexpectedly joined
      the Ibis at Genoa, he saw that the change, at first insidious and
      unperceived, dated from the ill-fated day when the Hickses had run across
      a Reigning Prince on his travels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hitherto they had been proof against such perils: both Mr. and Mrs. Hicks
      had often declared that the aristocracy of the intellect was the only one
      which attracted them. But in this case the Prince possessed an intellect,
      in addition to his few square miles of territory, and to one of the most
      beautiful Field Marshal&rsquo;s uniforms that had ever encased a royal warrior.
      The Prince was not a warrior, however; he was stooping, pacific and
      spectacled, and his possession of the uniform had been revealed to Mrs.
      Hicks only by the gift of a full-length photograph in a Bond Street frame,
      with Anastasius written slantingly across its legs. The Prince&mdash;and
      herein lay the Hickses&rsquo; undoing&mdash;the Prince was an archaeologist: an
      earnest anxious enquiring and scrupulous archaeologist. Delicate health
      (so his suite hinted) banished him for a part of each year from his cold
      and foggy principality; and in the company of his mother, the active and
      enthusiastic Dowager Princess, he wandered from one Mediterranean shore to
      another, now assisting at the exhumation of Ptolemaic mummies, now at the
      excavation of Delphic temples or of North African basilicas. The beginning
      of winter usually brought the Prince and his mother to Rome or Nice,
      unless indeed they were summoned by family duties to Berlin, Vienna or
      Madrid; for an extended connection with the principal royal houses of
      Europe compelled them, as the Princess Mother said, to be always burying
      or marrying a cousin. At other moments they were seldom seen in the
      glacial atmosphere of courts, preferring to royal palaces those of the
      other, and more modern type, in one of which the Hickses were now lodged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes: the Prince and his mother (they gaily avowed it) revelled in Palace
      Hotels; and, being unable to afford the luxury of inhabiting them, they
      liked, as often as possible, to be invited to dine there by their friends&mdash;&ldquo;or
      even to tea, my dear,&rdquo; the Princess laughingly avowed, &ldquo;for I&rsquo;m so awfully
      fond of buttered scones; and Anastasius gives me so little to eat in the
      desert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The encounter with these ambulant Highnesses had been fatal&mdash;Lansing
      now perceived it&mdash;to Mrs. Hicks&rsquo;s principles. She had known a great
      many archaeologists, but never one as agreeable as the Prince, and above
      all never one who had left a throne to camp in the desert and delve in
      Libyan tombs. And it seemed to her infinitely pathetic that these two
      gifted beings, who grumbled when they had to go to &ldquo;marry a cousin&rdquo; at the
      Palace of St. James or of Madrid, and hastened back breathlessly to the
      far-off point where, metaphorically speaking, pick-axe and spade had
      dropped from their royal hands&mdash;that these heirs of the ages should
      be unable to offer themselves the comforts of up-to-date hotel life, and
      should enjoy themselves &ldquo;like babies&rdquo; when they were invited to the other
      kind of &ldquo;Palace,&rdquo; to feast on buttered scones and watch the tango.
    </p>
    <p>
      She simply could not bear the thought of their privations; and neither,
      after a time, could Mr. Hicks, who found the Prince more democratic than
      anyone he had ever known at Apex City, and was immensely interested by the
      fact that their spectacles came from the same optician.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was, above all, the artistic tendencies of the Prince and his
      mother which had conquered the Hickses. There was fascination in the
      thought that, among the rabble of vulgar uneducated royalties who overran
      Europe from Biarritz to the Engadine, gambling, tangoing, and sponging on
      no less vulgar plebeians, they, the unobtrusive and self-respecting
      Hickses, should have had the luck to meet this cultivated pair, who joined
      them in gentle ridicule of their own frivolous kinsfolk, and whose tastes
      were exactly those of the eccentric, unreliable and sometimes
      money-borrowing persons who had hitherto represented the higher life to
      the Hickses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now at last Mrs. Hicks saw the possibility of being at once artistic and
      luxurious, of surrendering herself to the joys of modern plumbing and yet
      keeping the talk on the highest level. &ldquo;If the poor dear Princess wants to
      dine at the Nouveau Luxe why shouldn&rsquo;t we give her that pleasure?&rdquo; Mrs.
      Hicks smilingly enquired; &ldquo;and as for enjoying her buttered scones like a
      baby, as she says, I think it&rsquo;s the sweetest thing about her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Coral Hicks did not join in this chorus; but she accepted, with her
      curious air of impartiality, the change in her parents&rsquo; manner of life,
      and for the first time (as Nick observed) occupied herself with her
      mother&rsquo;s toilet, with the result that Mrs. Hicks&rsquo;s outline became firmer,
      her garments soberer in hue and finer in material; so that, should anyone
      chance to detect the daughter&rsquo;s likeness to her mother, the result was
      less likely to be disturbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such precautions were the more needful&mdash;Lansing could not but note
      because of the different standards of the society in which the Hickses now
      moved. For it was a curious fact that admission to the intimacy of the
      Prince and his mother&mdash;who continually declared themselves to be the
      pariahs, the outlaws, the Bohemians among crowned heads nevertheless
      involved not only living in Palace Hotels but mixing with those who
      frequented them. The Prince&rsquo;s aide-de-camp&mdash;an agreeable young man of
      easy manners&mdash;had smilingly hinted that their Serene Highnesses,
      though so thoroughly democratic and unceremonious, were yet accustomed to
      inspecting in advance the names of the persons whom their hosts wished to
      invite with them; and Lansing noticed that Mrs. Hicks&rsquo;s lists, having been
      &ldquo;submitted,&rdquo; usually came back lengthened by the addition of numerous
      wealthy and titled guests. Their Highnesses never struck out a name; they
      welcomed with enthusiasm and curiosity the Hickses&rsquo; oddest and most
      inexplicable friends, at most putting off some of them to a later day on
      the plea that it would be &ldquo;cosier&rdquo; to meet them on a more private
      occasion; but they invariably added to the list any friends of their own,
      with the gracious hint that they wished these latter (though socially so
      well-provided for) to have the &ldquo;immense privilege&rdquo; of knowing the Hickses.
      And thus it happened that when October gales necessitated laying up the
      Ibis, the Hickses, finding again in Rome the august travellers from whom
      they had parted the previous month in Athens, also found their
      visiting-list enlarged by all that the capital contained of fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was true enough, as Lansing had not failed to note, that the Princess
      Mother adored prehistoric art, and Russian music, and the paintings of
      Gauguin and Matisse; but she also, and with a beaming unconsciousness of
      perspective, adored large pearls and powerful motors, caravan tea and
      modern plumbing, perfumed cigarettes and society scandals; and her son,
      while apparently less sensible to these forms of luxury, adored his
      mother, and was charmed to gratify her inclinations without cost to
      himself&mdash;&ldquo;Since poor Mamma,&rdquo; as he observed, &ldquo;is so courageous when
      we are roughing it in the desert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The smiling aide-de-camp, who explained these things to Lansing, added
      with an intenser smile that the Prince and his mother were under
      obligations, either social or cousinly, to most of the titled persons whom
      they begged Mrs. Hicks to invite; &ldquo;and it seems to their Serene
      Highnesses,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;the most flattering return they can make for the
      hospitality of their friends to give them such an intellectual
      opportunity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dinner-table at which their Highnesses&rsquo; friends were seated on the
      evening in question represented, numerically, one of the greatest
      intellectual opportunities yet afforded them. Thirty guests were grouped
      about the flower-wreathed board, from which Eldorada and Mr. Beck had been
      excluded on the plea that the Princess Mother liked cosy parties and
      begged her hosts that there should never be more than thirty at table.
      Such, at least, was the reason given by Mrs. Hicks to her faithful
      followers; but Lansing had observed that, of late, the same skilled hand
      which had refashioned the Hickses&rsquo; social circle usually managed to
      exclude from it the timid presences of the two secretaries. Their
      banishment was the more displeasing to Lansing from the fact that, for the
      last three months, he had filled Mr. Buttles&rsquo;s place, and was himself
      their salaried companion. But since he had accepted the post, his obvious
      duty was to fill it in accordance with his employers&rsquo; requirements; and it
      was clear even to Eldorada and Mr. Beck that he had, as Eldorada
      ungrudgingly said, &ldquo;Something of Mr. Buttles&rsquo;s marvellous social gifts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During the cruise his task had not been distasteful to him. He was glad of
      any definite duties, however trivial, he felt more independent as the
      Hickses&rsquo; secretary than as their pampered guest, and the large cheque
      which Mr. Hicks handed over to him on the first of each month refreshed
      his languishing sense of self-respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      He considered himself absurdly over-paid, but that was the Hickses&rsquo;
      affair; and he saw nothing humiliating in being in the employ of people he
      liked and respected. But from the moment of the ill-fated encounter with
      the wandering Princes, his position had changed as much as that of his
      employers. He was no longer, to Mr. and Mrs. Hicks, a useful and estimable
      assistant, on the same level as Eldorada and Mr. Beck; he had become a
      social asset of unsuspected value, equalling Mr. Buttles in his capacity
      for dealing with the mysteries of foreign etiquette, and surpassing him in
      the art of personal attraction. Nick Lansing, the Hickses found, already
      knew most of the Princess Mother&rsquo;s rich and aristocratic friends. Many of
      them hailed him with enthusiastic &ldquo;Old Nicks&rdquo;, and he was almost as
      familiar as His Highness&rsquo;s own aide-de-camp with all those secret
      ramifications of love and hate that made dinner-giving so much more of a
      science in Rome than at Apex City.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hicks, at first, had hopelessly lost her way in this labyrinth of
      subterranean scandals, rivalries and jealousies; and finding Lansing&rsquo;s
      hand within reach she clung to it with pathetic tenacity. But if the young
      man&rsquo;s value had risen in the eyes of his employers it had deteriorated in
      his own. He was condemned to play a part he had not bargained for, and it
      seemed to him more degrading when paid in bank-notes than if his
      retribution had consisted merely in good dinners and luxurious lodgings.
      The first time the smiling aide-de-camp had caught his eye over a verbal
      slip of Mrs. Hicks&rsquo;s, Nick had flushed to the forehead and gone to bed
      swearing that he would chuck his job the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two months had passed since then, and he was still the paid secretary. He
      had contrived to let the aide-de-camp feel that he was too deficient in
      humour to be worth exchanging glances with; but even this had not restored
      his self-respect, and on the evening in question, as he looked about the
      long table, he said to himself for the hundredth time that he would give
      up his position on the morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only&mdash;what was the alternative? The alternative, apparently, was
      Coral Hicks. He glanced down the line of diners, beginning with the tall
      lean countenance of the Princess Mother, with its small inquisitive eyes
      perched as high as attic windows under a frizzled thatch of hair and a
      pediment of uncleaned diamonds; passed on to the vacuous and overfed or
      fashionably haggard masks of the ladies next in rank; and finally caught,
      between branching orchids, a distant glimpse of Miss Hicks.
    </p>
    <p>
      In contrast with the others, he thought, she looked surprisingly noble.
      Her large grave features made her appear like an old monument in a street
      of Palace Hotels; and he marvelled at the mysterious law which had brought
      this archaic face out of Apex City, and given to the oldest society of
      Europe a look of such mixed modernity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lansing perceived that the aide-de-camp, who was his neighbour, was also
      looking at Miss Hicks. His expression was serious, and even thoughtful;
      but as his eyes met Lansing&rsquo;s he readjusted his official smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was admiring our hostess&rsquo;s daughter. Her absence of jewels is&mdash;er&mdash;an
      inspiration,&rdquo; he remarked in the confidential tone which Lansing had come
      to dread.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Miss Hicks is full of inspirations,&rdquo; he returned curtly, and the
      aide-de-camp bowed with an admiring air, as if inspirations were rarer
      than pearls, as in his milieu they undoubtedly were. &ldquo;She is the equal of
      any situation, I am sure,&rdquo; he replied; and then abandoned the subject with
      one of his automatic transitions.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner, in the embrasure of a drawing-room window, he surprised Nick
      by returning to the same topic, and this time without thinking it needful
      to readjust his smile. His face remained serious, though his manner was
      studiously informal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was admiring, at dinner, Miss Hicks&rsquo;s invariable sense of
      appropriateness. It must permit her friends to foresee for her almost any
      future, however exalted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lansing hesitated, and controlled his annoyance. Decidedly he wanted to
      know what was in his companion&rsquo;s mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by exalted?&rdquo; he asked, with a smile of faint amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;equal to her marvellous capacity for shining in the public
      eye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lansing still smiled. &ldquo;The question is, I suppose, whether her desire to
      shine equals her capacity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The aide-de-camp stared. &ldquo;You mean, she&rsquo;s not ambitious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary; I believe her to be immeasurably ambitious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Immeasurably?&rdquo; The aide-de-camp seemed to try to measure it. &ldquo;But not,
      surely, beyond&mdash;beyond what we can offer,&rdquo; his eyes completed the
      sentence; and it was Lansing&rsquo;s turn to stare. The aide-de-camp faced the
      stare. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; his eyes concluded in a flash, while his lips let fall: &ldquo;The
      Princess Mother admires her immensely.&rdquo; But at that moment a wave of Mrs.
      Hicks&rsquo;s fan drew them hurriedly from their embrasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Professor Darchivio had promised to explain to us the difference between
      the Sassanian and Byzantine motives in Carolingian art; but the Manager
      has sent up word that the two new Creole dancers from Paris have arrived,
      and her Serene Highness wants to pop down to the ball-room and take a peep
      at them.... She&rsquo;s sure the Professor will understand....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And accompany us, of course,&rdquo; the Princess irresistibly added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lansing&rsquo;s brief colloquy in the Nouveau Luxe window had lifted the scales
      from his eyes. Innumerable dim corners of memory had been flooded with
      light by that one quick glance of the aide-de-camp&rsquo;s: things he had heard,
      hints he had let pass, smiles, insinuations, cordialities, rumours of the
      improbability of the Prince&rsquo;s founding a family, suggestions as to the
      urgent need of replenishing the Teutoburger treasury....
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Hicks, perforce, had accompanied her parents and their princely
      guests to the ballroom; but as she did not dance, and took little interest
      in the sight of others so engaged, she remained aloof from the party,
      absorbed in an archaeological discussion with the baffled but smiling
      savant who was to have enlightened the party on the difference between
      Sassanian and Byzantine ornament.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lansing, also aloof, had picked out a post from which he could observe the
      girl: she wore a new look to him since he had seen her as the centre of
      all these scattered threads of intrigue. Yes; decidedly she was growing
      handsomer; or else she had learned how to set off her massive lines
      instead of trying to disguise them. As she held up her long eye-glass to
      glance absently at the dancers he was struck by the large beauty of her
      arm and the careless assurance of the gesture. There was nothing nervous
      or fussy about Coral Hicks; and he was not surprised that, plastically at
      least, the Princess Mother had discerned her possibilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nick Lansing, all that night, sat up and stared at his future. He knew
      enough of the society into which the Hickses had drifted to guess that,
      within a very short time, the hint of the Prince&rsquo;s aide-de-camp would
      reappear in the form of a direct proposal. Lansing himself would probably&mdash;as
      the one person in the Hicks entourage with whom one could intelligibly
      commune&mdash;be entrusted with the next step in the negotiations: he would be
      asked, as the aide-de-camp would have said, &ldquo;to feel the ground.&rdquo; It was
      clearly part of the state policy of Teutoburg to offer Miss Hicks, with
      the hand of its sovereign, an opportunity to replenish its treasury.
    </p>
    <p>
      What would the girl do? Lansing could not guess; yet he dimly felt that
      her attitude would depend in a great degree upon his own. And he knew no
      more what his own was going to be than on the night, four months earlier,
      when he had flung out of his wife&rsquo;s room in Venice to take the midnight
      express for Genoa.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole of his past, and above all the tendency, on which he had once
      prided himself, to live in the present and take whatever chances it
      offered, now made it harder for him to act. He began to see that he had
      never, even in the closest relations of life, looked ahead of his
      immediate satisfaction. He had thought it rather fine to be able to give
      himself so intensely to the fullness of each moment instead of hurrying
      past it in pursuit of something more, or something else, in the manner of
      the over-scrupulous or the under-imaginative, whom he had always grouped
      together and equally pitied. It was not till he had linked his life with
      Susy&rsquo;s that he had begun to feel it reaching forward into a future he
      longed to make sure of, to fasten upon and shape to his own wants and
      purposes, till, by an imperceptible substitution, that future had become
      his real present, his all-absorbing moment of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the moment was shattered, and the power to rebuild it failed him. He
      had never before thought about putting together broken bits: he felt like
      a man whose house has been wrecked by an earthquake, and who, for lack of
      skilled labour, is called upon for the first time to wield a trowel and
      carry bricks. He simply did not know how.
    </p>
    <p>
      Will-power, he saw, was not a thing one could suddenly decree oneself to
      possess. It must be built up imperceptibly and laboriously out of a
      succession of small efforts to meet definite objects, out of the facing of
      daily difficulties instead of cleverly eluding them, or shifting their
      burden on others. The making of the substance called character was a
      process about as slow and arduous as the building of the Pyramids; and the
      thing itself, like those awful edifices, was mainly useful to lodge one&rsquo;s
      descendants in, after they too were dust. Yet the Pyramid-instinct was the
      one which had made the world, made man, and caused his fugitive joys to
      linger like fading frescoes on imperishable walls....
    </p>


<h3>XXI.</h3>

    <p>
      <span class="smcap">On</span> the drive back from her dinner at the Nouveau Luxe, events had followed
      the course foreseen by Susy.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had promised Strefford to seek legal advice about her divorce, and he
      had kissed her; and the promise had been easier to make than she had
      expected, the kiss less difficult to receive.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had gone to the dinner a-quiver with the mortification of learning
      that her husband was still with the Hickses. Morally sure of it though she
      had been, the discovery was a shock, and she measured for the first time
      the abyss between fearing and knowing. No wonder he had not written&mdash;the
      modern husband did not have to: he had only to leave it to time and the
      newspapers to make known his intentions. Susy could imagine Nick&rsquo;s saying
      to himself, as he sometimes used to say when she reminded him of an
      unanswered letter: &ldquo;But there are lots of ways of answering a letter&mdash;and
      writing doesn&rsquo;t happen to be mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well&mdash;he had done it in his way, and she was answered. For a minute,
      as she laid aside the paper, darkness submerged her, and she felt herself
      dropping down into the bottomless anguish of her dreadful vigil in the
      Palazzo Vanderlyn. But she was weary of anguish: her healthy body and
      nerves instinctively rejected it. The wave was spent, and she felt herself
      irresistibly struggling back to light and life and youth. He didn&rsquo;t want
      her! Well, she would try not to want him! There lay all the old expedients
      at her hand&mdash;the rouge for her white lips, the atropine for her
      blurred eyes, the new dress on her bed, the thought of Strefford and his
      guests awaiting her, and of the conclusions that the diners of the Nouveau
      Luxe would draw from seeing them together. Thank heaven no one would say:
      &ldquo;Poor old Susy&mdash;did you know Nick had chucked her?&rdquo; They would all
      say: &ldquo;Poor old Nick! Yes, I daresay she was sorry to chuck him; but
      Altringham&rsquo;s mad to marry her, and what could she do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And once again events had followed the course she had foreseen. Seeing her
      at Lord Altringham&rsquo;s table, with the Ascots and the old Duchess of Dunes,
      the interested spectators could not but regard the dinner as confirming
      the rumour of her marriage. As Ellie said, people didn&rsquo;t wait nowadays to
      announce their &ldquo;engagements&rdquo; till the tiresome divorce proceedings were
      over. Ellie herself, prodigally pearled and ermined, had floated in late
      with Algie Bockheimer in her wake, and sat, in conspicuous tête-à-tête,
      nodding and signalling her sympathy to Susy. Approval beamed from every
      eye: it was awfully exciting, they all seemed to say, seeing Susy Lansing
      pull it off! As the party, after dinner, drifted from the restaurant back
      into the hall, she caught, in the smiles and hand-pressures crowding about
      her, the scarcely-repressed hint of official congratulations; and Violet
      Melrose, seated in a corner with Fulmer, drew her down with a wan
      jade-circled arm, to whisper tenderly: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s most awfully clever of you,
      darling, not to be wearing any jewels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In all the women&rsquo;s eyes she read the reflected lustre of the jewels she
      could wear when she chose: it was as though their glitter reached her from
      the far-off bank where they lay sealed up in the Altringham strong-box.
      What a fool she had been to think that Strefford would ever believe she
      didn&rsquo;t care for them!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ambassadress, a blank perpendicular person, had been a shade less
      affable than Susy could have wished; but then there was Lady Joan&mdash;and
      the girl was handsome, alarmingly handsome to account for that: probably
      every one in the room had guessed it. And the old Duchess of Dunes was
      delightful. She looked rather like Strefford in a wig and false pearls
      (Susy was sure they were as false as her teeth); and her cordiality was so
      demonstrative that the future bride found it more difficult to account for
      than Lady Ascot&rsquo;s coldness, till she heard the old lady, as they passed
      into the hall, breathe in a hissing whisper to her nephew: &ldquo;Streff,
      dearest, when you have a minute&rsquo;s time, and can drop in at my wretched
      little pension, I know you can explain in two words what I ought to do to
      pacify those awful money-lenders.... And you&rsquo;ll bring your exquisite
      American to see me, won&rsquo;t you!... No, Joan Senechal&rsquo;s too fair for my
      taste.... Insipid....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes: the taste of it all was again sweet on her lips. A few days later she
      began to wonder how the thought of Strefford&rsquo;s endearments could have been
      so alarming. To be sure he was not lavish of them; but when he did touch
      her, even when he kissed her, it no longer seemed to matter. An almost
      complete absence of sensation had mercifully succeeded to the first wild
      flurry of her nerves.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so it would be, no doubt, with everything else in her new life. If it
      failed to provoke any acute reactions, whether of pain or pleasure, the
      very absence of sensation would make for peace. And in the meanwhile she
      was tasting what, she had begun to suspect, was the maximum of bliss to
      most of the women she knew: days packed with engagements, the exhilaration
      of fashionable crowds, the thrill of snapping up a jewel or a bibelot or a
      new &ldquo;model&rdquo; that one&rsquo;s best friend wanted, or of being invited to some
      private show, or some exclusive entertainment, that one&rsquo;s best friend
      couldn&rsquo;t get to. There was nothing, now, that she couldn&rsquo;t buy, nowhere
      that she couldn&rsquo;t go: she had only to choose and to triumph. And for a
      while the surface-excitement of her life gave her the illusion of
      enjoyment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strefford, as she had expected, had postponed his return to England, and
      they had now been for nearly three weeks together in their new, and
      virtually avowed, relation. She had fancied that, after all, the easiest
      part of it would be just the being with Strefford&mdash;the falling back
      on their old tried friendship to efface the sense of strangeness. But,
      though she had so soon grown used to his caresses, he himself remained
      curiously unfamiliar: she was hardly sure, at times, that it was the old
      Strefford she was talking to. It was not that his point of view had
      changed, but that new things occupied and absorbed him. In all the small
      sides of his great situation he took an almost childish satisfaction; and
      though he still laughed at both its privileges and its obligations, it was
      now with a jealous laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      It amused him inexhaustibly, for instance, to be made up to by all the
      people who had always disapproved of him, and to unite at the same table
      persons who had to dissemble their annoyance at being invited together
      lest they should not be invited at all. Equally exhilarating was the
      capricious favouring of the dull and dowdy on occasions when the brilliant
      and disreputable expected his notice. It enchanted him, for example, to
      ask the old Duchess of Dunes and Violet Melrose to dine with the Vicar of
      Altringham, on his way to Switzerland for a month&rsquo;s holiday, and to watch
      the face of the Vicar&rsquo;s wife while the Duchess narrated her last
      difficulties with book-makers and money-lenders, and Violet proclaimed the
      rights of Love and Genius to all that had once been supposed to belong
      exclusively to Respectability and Dulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Susy had to confess that her own amusements were hardly of a higher order;
      but then she put up with them for lack of better, whereas Strefford, who
      might have had what he pleased, was completely satisfied with such
      triumphs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow, in spite of his honours and his opportunities, he seemed to have
      shrunk. The old Strefford had certainly been a larger person, and she
      wondered if material prosperity were always a beginning of ossification.
      Strefford had been much more fun when he lived by his wits. Sometimes,
      now, when he tried to talk of politics, or assert himself on some question
      of public interest, she was startled by his limitations. Formerly, when he
      was not sure of his ground, it had been his way to turn the difficulty by
      glib nonsense or easy irony; now he was actually dull, at times almost
      pompous. She noticed too, for the first time, that he did not always hear
      clearly when several people were talking at once, or when he was at the
      theatre; and he developed a habit of saying over and over again: &ldquo;Does
      so-and-so speak indistinctly? Or am I getting deaf, I wonder?&rdquo; which wore
      on her nerves by its suggestion of a corresponding mental infirmity.
    </p>
    <p>
      These thoughts did not always trouble her. The current of idle activity on
      which they were both gliding was her native element as well as his; and
      never had its tide been as swift, its waves as buoyant. In his relation to
      her, too, he was full of tact and consideration. She saw that he still
      remembered their frightened exchange of glances after their first kiss;
      and the sense of this little hidden spring of imagination in him was
      sometimes enough for her thirst.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had always had a rather masculine punctuality in keeping her word, and
      after she had promised Strefford to take steps toward a divorce she had
      promptly set about doing it. A sudden reluctance prevented her asking the
      advice of friends like Ellie Vanderlyn, whom she knew to be in the thick
      of the same negotiations, and all she could think of was to consult a
      young American lawyer practicing in Paris, with whom she felt she could
      talk the more easily because he was not from New York, and probably
      unacquainted with her history.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was so ignorant of the procedure in such matters that she was
      surprised and relieved at his asking few personal questions; but it was a
      shock to learn that a divorce could not be obtained, either in New York or
      Paris, merely on the ground of desertion or incompatibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought nowadays... if people preferred to live apart... it could
      always be managed,&rdquo; she stammered, wondering at her own ignorance, after
      the many conjugal ruptures she had assisted at.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young lawyer smiled, and coloured slightly. His lovely client
      evidently intimidated him by her grace, and still more by her
      inexperience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can be&mdash;generally,&rdquo; he admitted; &ldquo;and especially so if... as I
      gather is the case... your husband is equally anxious....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, quite!&rdquo; she exclaimed, suddenly humiliated by having to admit it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then&mdash;may I suggest that, to bring matters to a point, the
      best way would be for you to write to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She recoiled slightly. It had never occurred to her that the lawyers would
      not &ldquo;manage it&rdquo; without her intervention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Write to him... but what about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, expressing your wish... to recover your freedom.... The rest, I
      assume,&rdquo; said the young lawyer, &ldquo;may be left to Mr. Lansing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not know exactly what he meant, and was too much perturbed by the
      idea of having to communicate with Nick to follow any other train of
      thought. How could she write such a letter? And yet how could she confess
      to the lawyer that she had not the courage to do so? He would, of course,
      tell her to go home and be reconciled. She hesitated perplexedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be better,&rdquo; she suggested, &ldquo;if the letter were to come from&mdash;from
      your office?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He considered this politely. &ldquo;On the whole: no. If, as I take it, an
      amicable arrangement is necessary&mdash;to secure the requisite evidence
      then a line from you, suggesting an interview, seems to me more
      advisable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An interview? Is an interview necessary?&rdquo; She was ashamed to show her
      agitation to this cautiously smiling young man, who must wonder at her
      childish lack of understanding; but the break in her voice was
      uncontrollable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, please write to him&mdash;I can&rsquo;t! And I can&rsquo;t see him! Oh, can&rsquo;t you
      arrange it for me?&rdquo; she pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw now that her idea of a divorce had been that it was something one
      went out&mdash;or sent out&mdash;to buy in a shop: something concrete and
      portable, that Strefford&rsquo;s money could pay for, and that it required no
      personal participation to obtain. What a fool the lawyer must think her!
      Stiffening herself, she rose from her seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My husband and I don&rsquo;t wish to see each other again.... I&rsquo;m sure it would
      be useless... and very painful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are the best judge, of course. But in any case, a letter from you, a
      friendly letter, seems wiser... considering the apparent lack of
      evidence....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then; I&rsquo;ll write,&rdquo; she agreed, and hurried away, scarcely
      hearing his parting injunction that she should take a copy of her letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night she wrote. At the last moment it might have been impossible, if
      at the theatre little Breckenridge had not bobbed into her box. He was
      just back from Rome, where he had dined with the Hickses (&ldquo;a bang-up show&mdash;they&rsquo;re
      really lances&mdash;you wouldn&rsquo;t know them!&rdquo;), and had met there Lansing, whom
      he reported as intending to marry Coral &ldquo;as soon as things were settled&rdquo;.
      &ldquo;You were dead right, weren&rsquo;t you, Susy,&rdquo; he snickered, &ldquo;that night in
      Venice last summer, when we all thought you were joking about their
      engagement? Pity now you chucked our surprise visit to the Hickses, and
      sent Streff up to drag us back just as we were breaking in! You remember?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He flung off the &ldquo;Streff&rdquo; airily, in the old way, but with a tentative
      side-glance at his host; and Lord Altringham, leaning toward Susy, said
      coldly: &ldquo;Was Breckenridge speaking about me? I didn&rsquo;t catch what he said.
      Does he speak indistinctly&mdash;or am I getting deaf, I wonder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After that it seemed comparatively easy, when Strefford had dropped her at
      her hotel, to go upstairs and write. She dashed off the date and her
      address, and then stopped; but suddenly she remembered Breckenridge&rsquo;s
      snicker, and the words rushed from her. &ldquo;Nick dear, it was July when you
      left Venice, and I have had no word from you since the note in which you
      said you had gone for a few days, and that I should hear soon again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t written yet, and it is five months since you left me. That
      means, I suppose, that you want to take back your freedom and give me
      mine. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be kinder, in that case, to tell me so? It is worse than
      anything to go on as we are now. I don&rsquo;t know how to put these things but
      since you seem unwilling to write to me perhaps you would prefer to send
      your answer to Mr. Frederic Spearman, the American lawyer here. His
      address is 100, Boulevard Haussmann. I hope&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She broke off on the last word. Hope? What did she hope, either for him or
      for herself? Wishes for his welfare would sound like a mockery&mdash;and
      she would rather her letter should seem bitter than unfeeling. Above all,
      she wanted to get it done. To have to re-write even those few lines would
      be torture. So she left &ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; and simply added: &ldquo;to hear before long
      what you have decided.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She read it over, and shivered. Not one word of the past&mdash;not one allusion
      to that mysterious interweaving of their lives which had enclosed them one
      in the other like the flower in its sheath! What place had such memories
      in such a letter? She had the feeling that she wanted to hide that other
      Nick away in her own bosom, and with him the other Susy, the Susy he had
      once imagined her to be.... Neither of them seemed concerned with the
      present business.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter done, she stared at the sealed envelope till its presence in
      the room became intolerable, and she understood that she must either tear
      it up or post it immediately. She went down to the hall of the sleeping
      hotel, and bribed the night-porter to carry the letter to the nearest post
      office, though he objected that, at that hour, no time would be gained. &ldquo;I
      want it out of the house,&rdquo; she insisted: and waited sternly by the desk,
      in her dressing-gown, till he had performed the errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she re-entered her room, the disordered writing-table struck her; and
      she remembered the lawyer&rsquo;s injunction to take a copy of her letter. A
      copy to be filed away with the documents in &ldquo;Lansing versus Lansing!&rdquo; She
      burst out laughing at the idea. What were lawyers made of, she wondered?
      Didn&rsquo;t the man guess, by the mere look in her eyes and the sound of her
      voice, that she would never, as long as she lived, forget a word of that
      letter&mdash;that night after night she would lie down, as she was lying
      down to-night, to stare wide-eyed for hours into the darkness, while a
      voice in her brain monotonously hammered out: &ldquo;Nick dear, it was July when
      you left me...&rdquo; and so on, word after word, down to the last fatal
      syllable?
    </p>


<h3>XXII.</h3>

    <p>
      <span class="smcap">Strefford</span> was leaving for England.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once assured that Susy had taken the first step toward freeing herself, he
      frankly regarded her as his affianced wife, and could see no reason for
      further mystery. She understood his impatience to have their plans
      settled; it would protect him from the formidable menace of the
      marriageable, and cause people, as he said, to stop meddling. Now that the
      novelty of his situation was wearing off, his natural indolence reasserted
      itself, and there was nothing he dreaded more than having to be on his
      guard against the innumerable plans that his well-wishers were perpetually
      making for him. Sometimes Susy fancied he was marrying her because to do
      so was to follow the line of least resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To marry me is the easiest way of not marrying all the others,&rdquo; she
      laughed, as he stood before her one day in a quiet alley of the Bois de
      Boulogne, insisting on the settlement of various preliminaries. &ldquo;I believe
      I&rsquo;m only a protection to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An odd gleam passed behind his eyes, and she instantly guessed that he was
      thinking: &ldquo;And what else am I to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She changed colour, and he rejoined, laughing also: &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re that at
      any rate, thank the Lord!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pondered, and then questioned: &ldquo;But in the interval&mdash;how are you going
      to defend yourself for another year?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you&rsquo;ve got to see to that; you&rsquo;ve got to take a little house in
      London. You&rsquo;ve got to look after me, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was on the tip of her tongue to flash back: &ldquo;Oh, if that&rsquo;s all you care&mdash;!&rdquo;
       But caring was exactly the factor she wanted, as much as possible, to keep
      out of their talk and their thoughts. She could not ask him how much he
      cared without laying herself open to the same question; and that way
      terror lay. As a matter of fact, though Strefford was not an ardent wooer&mdash;perhaps
      from tact, perhaps from temperament, perhaps merely from the long habit of
      belittling and disintegrating every sentiment and every conviction&mdash;yet
      she knew he did care for her as much as he was capable of caring for
      anyone. If the element of habit entered largely into the feeling&mdash;if
      he liked her, above all, because he was used to her, knew her views, her
      indulgences, her allowances, knew he was never likely to be bored, and
      almost certain to be amused, by her; why, such ingredients though not of
      the fieriest, were perhaps those most likely to keep his feeling for her
      at a pleasant temperature. She had had a taste of the tropics, and wanted
      more equable weather; but the idea of having to fan his flame gently for a
      year was unspeakably depressing to her. Yet all this was precisely what
      she could not say. The long period of probation, during which, as she
      knew, she would have to amuse him, to guard him, to hold him, and to keep
      off the other women, was a necessary part of their situation. She was sure
      that, as little Breckenridge would have said, she could &ldquo;pull it off&rdquo;; but
      she did not want to think about it. What she would have preferred would
      have been to go away&mdash;no matter where and not see Strefford again
      till they were married. But she dared not tell him that either.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little house in London&mdash;?&rdquo; She wondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I suppose you&rsquo;ve got to have some sort of a roof over your head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat down beside her. &ldquo;If you like me well enough to live at Altringham
      some day, won&rsquo;t you, in the meantime, let me provide you with a smaller
      and more convenient establishment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still she hesitated. The alternative, she knew, would be to live on Ursula
      Gillow, Violet Melrose, or some other of her rich friends, any one of whom
      would be ready to lavish the largest hospitality on the prospective Lady
      Altringham. Such an arrangement, in the long run, would be no less
      humiliating to her pride, no less destructive to her independence, than
      Altringham&rsquo;s little establishment. But she temporized. &ldquo;I shall go over to
      London in December, and stay for a while with various people&mdash;then we
      can look about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right; as you like.&rdquo; He obviously considered her hesitation
      ridiculous, but was too full of satisfaction at her having started divorce
      proceedings to be chilled by her reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, look here, my dear; couldn&rsquo;t I give you some sort of a ring?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A ring?&rdquo; She flushed at the suggestion. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use, Streff, dear?
      With all those jewels locked away in London&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I daresay you&rsquo;ll think them old-fashioned. And, hang it, why
      shouldn&rsquo;t I give you something new, I ran across Ellie and Bockheimer
      yesterday, in the rue de la Paix, picking out sapphires. Do you like
      sapphires, or emeralds? Or just a diamond? I&rsquo;ve seen a thumping one....
      I&rsquo;d like you to have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ellie and Bockheimer! How she hated the conjunction of the names! Their
      case always seemed to her like a caricature of her own, and she felt an
      unreasoning resentment against Ellie for having selected the same season
      for her unmating and re-mating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t speak of them, Streff... as if they were like us! I
      can hardly bear to sit in the same room with Ellie Vanderlyn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo? What&rsquo;s wrong? You mean because of her giving up Clarissa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that only.... You don&rsquo;t know.... I can&rsquo;t tell you....&rdquo; She shivered
      at the memory, and rose restlessly from the bench where they had been
      sitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strefford gave his careless shrug. &ldquo;Well, my dear, you can hardly expect
      me to agree, for after all it was to Ellie I owed the luck of being so
      long alone with you in Venice. If she and Algie hadn&rsquo;t prolonged their
      honeymoon at the villa&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped abruptly, and looked at Susy. She was conscious that every drop
      of blood had left her face. She felt it ebbing away from her heart,
      flowing out of her as if from all her severed arteries, till it seemed as
      though nothing were left of life in her but one point of irreducible pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ellie&mdash;at your villa? What do you mean? Was it Ellie and Bockheimer
      who&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Strefford still stared. &ldquo;You mean to say you didn&rsquo;t know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who came after Nick and me...?&rdquo; she insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, do you suppose I&rsquo;d have turned you out otherwise? That beastly
      Bockheimer simply smothered me with gold. Ah, well, there&rsquo;s one good
      thing: I shall never have to let the villa again! I rather like the little
      place myself, and I daresay once in a while we might go there for a day or
      two.... Susy, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She returned his stare, but without seeing him. Everything swam and danced
      before her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then she was there while I was posting all those letters for her&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Letters&mdash;what letters? What makes you look so frightfully upset?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pursued her thought as if he had not spoken. &ldquo;She and Algie Bockheimer
      arrived there the very day that Nick and I left?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so. I thought she&rsquo;d told you. Ellie always tells everybody
      everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She would have told me, I daresay&mdash;but I wouldn&rsquo;t let her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear, that was hardly my fault, was it? Though I really don&rsquo;t
      see&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Susy, still blind to everything but the dance of dizzy sparks before
      her eyes, pressed on as if she had not heard him. &ldquo;It was their motor,
      then, that took us to Milan! It was Algie Bockheimer&rsquo;s motor!&rdquo; She did not
      know why, but this seemed to her the most humiliating incident in the
      whole hateful business. She remembered Nick&rsquo;s reluctance to use the
      motor&mdash;she remembered his look when she had boasted of her &ldquo;managing.&rdquo; The
      nausea mounted to her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strefford burst out laughing. &ldquo;I say&mdash;you borrowed their motor? And
      you didn&rsquo;t know whose it was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could I know? I persuaded the chauffeur... for a little tip.... It
      was to save our railway fares to Milan... extra luggage costs so
      frightfully in Italy....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good old Susy! Well done! I can see you doing it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how horrible&mdash;how horrible!&rdquo; she groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Horrible? What&rsquo;s horrible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, your not seeing... not feeling...&rdquo; she began impetuously; and then
      stopped. How could she explain to him that what revolted her was not so
      much the fact of his having given the little house, as soon as she and
      Nick had left it, to those two people of all others&mdash;though the
      vision of them in the sweet secret house, and under the plane-trees of the
      terrace, drew such a trail of slime across her golden hours? No, it was
      not that from which she most recoiled, but from the fact that Strefford,
      living in luxury in Nelson Vanderlyn&rsquo;s house, should at the same time have
      secretly abetted Ellie Vanderlyn&rsquo;s love-affairs, and allowed her&mdash;for
      a handsome price&mdash;to shelter them under his own roof. The reproach
      trembled on her lip&mdash;but she remembered her own part in the wretched
      business, and the impossibility of avowing it to Strefford, and of
      revealing to him that Nick had left her for that very reason. She was not
      afraid that the discovery would diminish her in Strefford&rsquo;s eyes: he was
      untroubled by moral problems, and would laugh away her avowal, with a
      sneer at Nick in his new part of moralist. But that was just what she
      could not bear: that anyone should cast a doubt on the genuineness of
      Nick&rsquo;s standards, or should know how far below them she had fallen.
    </p>
    <p>
      She remained silent, and Strefford, after a moment, drew her gently down
      to the seat beside him. &ldquo;Susy, upon my soul I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re
      driving at. Is it me you&rsquo;re angry with&mdash;or yourself? And what&rsquo;s it all
      about! Are you disgusted because I let the villa to a couple who weren&rsquo;t
      married! But, hang it, they&rsquo;re the kind that pay the highest price and I
      had to earn my living somehow! One doesn&rsquo;t run across a bridal pair every
      day....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She lifted her eyes to his puzzled incredulous face. Poor Streff! No, it
      was not with him that she was angry. Why should she be? Even that
      ill-advised disclosure had told her nothing she had not already known
      about him. It had simply revealed to her once more the real point of view
      of the people he and she lived among had shown her that, in spite of the
      superficial difference, he felt as they felt, judged as they judged, was
      blind as they were&mdash;and as she would be expected to be, should she once
      again become one of them. What was the use of being placed by fortune
      above such shifts and compromises, if in one&rsquo;s heart one still condoned
      them? And she would have to&mdash;she would catch the general note, grow
      blunted as those other people were blunted, and gradually come to wonder
      at her own revolt, as Strefford now honestly wondered at it. She felt as
      though she were on the point of losing some new-found treasure, a treasure
      precious only to herself, but beside which all he offered her was nothing,
      the triumph of her wounded pride nothing, the security of her future
      nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Susy?&rdquo; he asked, with the same puzzled gentleness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, the loneliness of never being able to make him understand! She had
      felt lonely enough when the flaming sword of Nick&rsquo;s indignation had shut
      her out from their Paradise; but there had been a cruel bliss in the pain.
      Nick had not opened her eyes to new truths, but had waked in her again
      something which had lain unconscious under years of accumulated
      indifference. And that re-awakened sense had never left her since, and had
      somehow kept her from utter loneliness because it was a secret shared with
      Nick, a gift she owed to Nick, and which, in leaving her, he could not
      take from her. It was almost, she suddenly felt, as if he had left her
      with a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear girl,&rdquo; Strefford said, with a resigned glance at his watch, &ldquo;you
      know we&rsquo;re dining at the Embassy....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the Embassy? She looked at him vaguely: then she remembered. Yes, they
      were dining that night at the Ascots&rsquo;, with Strefford&rsquo;s cousin, the Duke
      of Dunes, and his wife, the handsome irreproachable young Duchess; with
      the old gambling Dowager Duchess, whom her son and daughter-in-law had
      come over from England to see; and with other English and French guests of
      a rank and standing worthy of the Duneses. Susy knew that her inclusion in
      such a dinner could mean but one thing: it was her definite recognition as
      Altringham&rsquo;s future wife. She was &ldquo;the little American&rdquo; whom one had to
      ask when one invited him, even on ceremonial occasions. The family had
      accepted her; the Embassy could but follow suit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s late, dear; and I&rsquo;ve got to see someone on business first,&rdquo;
       Strefford reminded her patiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Streff&mdash;I can&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; The words broke from her without her
      knowing what she was saying. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go with you&mdash;I can&rsquo;t go to the
      Embassy. I can&rsquo;t go on any longer like this....&rdquo; She lifted her eyes to
      his in desperate appeal. &ldquo;Oh, understand&mdash;do please understand!&rdquo; she
      wailed, knowing, while she spoke, the utter impossibility of what she
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strefford&rsquo;s face had gradually paled and hardened. From sallow it turned
      to a dusky white, and lines of obstinacy deepened between the ironic
      eyebrows and about the weak amused mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Understand? What do you want me to understand,&rdquo; He laughed. &ldquo;That you&rsquo;re
      trying to chuck me already?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shrank at the sneer of the &ldquo;already,&rdquo; but instantly remembered that it
      was the only thing he could be expected to say, since it was just because
      he couldn&rsquo;t understand that she was flying from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Streff&mdash;if I knew how to tell you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t so much matter about the how. Is that what you&rsquo;re trying to
      say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her head drooped, and she saw the dead leaves whirling across the path at
      her feet, lifted on a sudden wintry gust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The reason,&rdquo; he continued, clearing his throat with a stiff smile, &ldquo;is
      not quite as important to me as the fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stood speechless, agonized by his pain. But still, she thought, he had
      remembered the dinner at the Embassy. The thought gave her courage to go
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t do, Streff. I&rsquo;m not a bit the kind of person to make you
      happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, leave that to me, please, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t. Because I should be unhappy too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He clicked at the leaves as they whirled past. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve taken a rather long
      time to find it out.&rdquo; She saw that his new-born sense of his own
      consequence was making him suffer even more than his wounded affection;
      and that again gave her courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I&rsquo;ve taken long it&rsquo;s all the more reason why I shouldn&rsquo;t take longer.
      If I&rsquo;ve made a mistake it&rsquo;s you who would have suffered from it....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for your extreme solicitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him helplessly, penetrated by the despairing sense of their
      inaccessibility to each other. Then she remembered that Nick, during their
      last talk together, had seemed as inaccessible, and wondered if, when
      human souls try to get too near each other, they do not inevitably become
      mere blurs to each other&rsquo;s vision. She would have liked to say this to
      Streff&mdash;but he would not have understood it either. The sense of loneliness
      once more enveloped her, and she groped in vain for a word that should
      reach him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me go home alone, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she appealed to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded. &ldquo;To-morrow&mdash;to-morrow....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tried, rather valiantly, to smile. &ldquo;Hang to-morrow! Whatever is wrong,
      it needn&rsquo;t prevent my seeing you home.&rdquo; He glanced toward the taxi that
      awaited them at the end of the deserted drive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, please. You&rsquo;re in a hurry; take the taxi. I want immensely a long
      long walk by myself... through the streets, with the lights coming
      out....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laid his hand on her arm. &ldquo;I say, my dear, you&rsquo;re not ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I&rsquo;m not ill. But you may say I am, to-night at the Embassy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He released her and drew back. &ldquo;Oh, very well,&rdquo; he answered coldly; and
      she understood by his tone that the knot was cut, and that at that moment
      he almost hated her. She turned away, hastening down the deserted alley,
      flying from him, and knowing, as she fled, that he was still standing
      there motionless, staring after her, wounded, humiliated, uncomprehending.
      It was neither her fault nor his....
    </p>


<h3>XXIII.</h3>

    <p>
      <span class="smcap">As</span> she fled on toward the lights of the streets a breath of freedom seemed
      to blow into her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like a weary load the accumulated hypocrisies of the last months had
      dropped from her: she was herself again, Nick&rsquo;s Susy, and no one else&rsquo;s.
      She sped on, staring with bright bewildered eyes at the stately facades of
      the La Muette quarter, the perspectives of bare trees, the awakening
      glitter of shop-windows holding out to her all the things she would never
      again be able to buy....
    </p>
    <p>
      In an avenue of shops she paused before a milliner&rsquo;s window, and said to
      herself: &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I earn my living by trimming hats?&rdquo; She met
      work-girls streaming out under a doorway, and scattering to catch trams
      and omnibuses; and she looked with newly-wakened interest at their tired
      independent faces. &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I earn my living as well as they do?&rdquo;
       she thought. A little farther on she passed a Sister of Charity with
      softly trotting feet, a calm anonymous glance, and hands hidden in her
      capacious sleeves. Susy looked at her and thought: &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I be a
      Sister, and have no money to worry about, and trot about under a white
      coif helping poor people?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All these strangers on whom she smiled in passing, and glanced back at
      enviously, were free from the necessities that enslaved her, and would not
      have known what she meant if she had told them that she must have so much
      money for her dresses, so much for her cigarettes, so much for bridge and
      cabs and tips, and all kinds of extras, and that at that moment she ought
      to be hurrying back to a dinner at the British Embassy, where her
      permanent right to such luxuries was to be solemnly recognized and
      ratified.
    </p>
    <p>
      The artificiality and unreality of her life overcame her as with stifling
      fumes. She stopped at a street-corner, drawing long panting breaths as if
      she had been running a race. Then, slowly and aimlessly, she began to
      saunter along a street of small private houses in damp gardens that led to
      the Avenue du Bois. She sat down on a bench. Not far off, the Arc de
      Triomphe raised its august bulk, and beyond it a river of lights streamed
      down toward Paris, and the stir of the city&rsquo;s heart-beats troubled the
      quiet in her bosom. But not for long. She seemed to be looking at it all
      from the other side of the grave; and as she got up and wandered down the
      Champs Elysees, half empty in the evening lull between dusk and dinner,
      she felt as if the glittering avenue were really changed into the Field of
      Shadows from which it takes its name, and as if she were a ghost among
      ghosts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Halfway home, a weakness of loneliness overcame her, and she seated
      herself under the trees near the Rond Point. Lines of motors and carriages
      were beginning to animate the converging thoroughfares, streaming abreast,
      crossing, winding in and out of each other in a tangle of hurried
      pleasure-seeking. She caught the light on jewels and shirt-fronts and hard
      bored eyes emerging from dim billows of fur and velvet. She seemed to hear
      what the couples were saying to each other, she pictured the
      drawing-rooms, restaurants, dance-halls they were hastening to, the
      breathless routine that was hurrying them along, as Time, the old
      vacuum-cleaner, swept them away with the dust of their carriage-wheels.
      And again the loneliness vanished in a sense of release....
    </p>
    <p>
      At the corner of the Place de la Concorde she stopped, recognizing a man
      in evening dress who was hailing a taxi. Their eyes met, and Nelson
      Vanderlyn came forward. He was the last person she cared to run across,
      and she shrank back involuntarily. What did he know, what had he guessed,
      of her complicity in his wife&rsquo;s affairs? No doubt Ellie had blabbed it all
      out by this time; she was just as likely to confide her love-affairs to
      Nelson as to anyone else, now that the Bockheimer prize was landed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;well&mdash;well&mdash;so I&rsquo;ve caught you at it! Glad to see
      you, Susy, my dear.&rdquo; She found her hand cordially clasped in Vanderlyn&rsquo;s,
      and his round pink face bent on her with all its old urbanity. Did nothing
      matter, then, in this world she was fleeing from, did no one love or hate
      or remember?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No idea you were in Paris&mdash;just got here myself,&rdquo; Vanderlyn
      continued, visibly delighted at the meeting. &ldquo;Look here, don&rsquo;t suppose
      you&rsquo;re out of a job this evening by any chance, and would come and cheer
      up a lone bachelor, eh? No? You are? Well, that&rsquo;s luck for once! I say,
      where shall we go? One of the places where they dance, I suppose? Yes, I
      twirl the light fantastic once in a while myself. Got to keep up with the
      times! Hold on, taxi! Here&mdash;I&rsquo;ll drive you home first, and wait while
      you jump into your toggery. Lots of time.&rdquo; As he steered her toward the
      carriage she noticed that he had a gouty limp, and pulled himself in after
      her with difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mayn&rsquo;t I come as I am, Nelson, I don&rsquo;t feel like dancing. Let&rsquo;s go and
      dine in one of those nice smoky little restaurants by the Place de la
      Bourse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seemed surprised but relieved at the suggestion, and they rolled off
      together. In a corner at Bauge&rsquo;s they found a quiet table, screened from
      the other diners, and while Vanderlyn adjusted his eyeglasses to study the
      carte Susy stole a long look at him. He was dressed with even more than
      his usual formal trimness, and she detected, in an ultra-flat wrist-watch
      and discreetly expensive waistcoat buttons, an attempt at smartness
      altogether new. His face had undergone the same change: its familiar look
      of worn optimism had been, as it were, done up to match his clothes, as
      though a sort of moral cosmetic had made him pinker, shinier and
      sprightlier without really rejuvenating him. A thin veil of high spirits
      had merely been drawn over his face, as the shining strands of hair were
      skilfully brushed over his baldness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here! Carte des vins, waiter! What champagne, Susy?&rdquo; He chose,
      fastidiously, the best the cellar could produce, grumbling a little at the
      bourgeois character of the dishes. &ldquo;Capital food of its kind, no doubt,
      but coarsish, don&rsquo;t you think? Well, I don&rsquo;t mind... it&rsquo;s rather a jolly
      change from the Luxe cooking. A new sensation&mdash;I&rsquo;m all for new
      sensations, ain&rsquo;t you, my dear?&rdquo; He re-filled their champagne glasses,
      flung an arm sideways over his chair, and smiled at her with a foggy
      benevolence.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the champagne flowed his confidences flowed with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose you know what I&rsquo;m here for&mdash;this divorce business? We wanted
      to settle it quietly without a fuss, and of course Paris is the best place
      for that sort of job. Live and let live; no questions asked. None of your
      dirty newspapers. Great country, this. No hypocrisy... they understand
      Life over here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susy gazed and listened. She remembered that people had thought Nelson
      would make a row when he found out. He had always been addicted to
      truculent anecdotes about unfaithful wives, and the very formula of his
      perpetual ejaculation&mdash;&ldquo;Caught you at it, eh?&rdquo;&mdash;seemed to hint
      at a constant preoccupation with such ideas. But now it was evident that,
      as the saying was, he had &ldquo;swallowed his dose&rdquo; like all the others. No
      strong blast of indignation had momentarily lifted him above his normal
      stature: he remained a little man among little men, and his eagerness to
      rebuild his life with all the old smiling optimism reminded Susy of the
      patient industry of an ant remaking its ruined ant-heap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell you what, great thing, this liberty! Everything&rsquo;s changed nowadays;
      why shouldn&rsquo;t marriage be too? A man can get out of a business partnership
      when he wants to; but the parsons want to keep us noosed up to each other
      for life because we&rsquo;ve blundered into a church one day and said &lsquo;Yes&rsquo;
      before one of ’em. No, no&mdash;that&rsquo;s too easy. We&rsquo;ve got beyond that.
      Science, and all these new discoveries.... I say the Ten Commandments were
      made for man, and not man for the Commandments; and there ain&rsquo;t a word
      against divorce in ’em, anyhow! That&rsquo;s what I tell my poor old mother, who
      builds everything on her Bible. Find me the place where it says: &lsquo;Thou
      shalt not sue for divorce.&rsquo; It makes her wild, poor old lady, because she
      can&rsquo;t; and she doesn&rsquo;t know how they happen to have left it out.... I
      rather think Moses left it out because he knew more about human nature
      than these snivelling modern parsons do. Not that they&rsquo;ll always bear
      investigating either; but I don&rsquo;t care about that. Live and let live, eh,
      Susy? Haven&rsquo;t we all got a right to our Affinities? I hear you&rsquo;re
      following our example yourself. First-rate idea: I don&rsquo;t mind telling you
      I saw it coming on last summer at Venice. Caught you at it, so to speak!
      Old Nelson ain&rsquo;t as blind as people think. Here, let&rsquo;s open another bottle
      to the health of Streff and Mrs. Streff!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She caught the hand with which he was signalling to the sommelier. This
      flushed and garrulous Nelson moved her more poignantly than a more heroic
      figure. &ldquo;No more champagne, please, Nelson. Besides,&rdquo; she suddenly added,
      &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stared. &ldquo;Not true that you&rsquo;re going to marry Altringham?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By George then what on earth did you chuck Nick for? Ain&rsquo;t you got an
      Affinity, my dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed and shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to tell me it&rsquo;s all Nick&rsquo;s doing, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Let&rsquo;s talk of you instead, Nelson. I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re in such
      good spirits. I rather thought&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He interrupted her quickly. &ldquo;Thought I&rsquo;d cut up a rumpus&mdash;do some shooting?
      I know&mdash;people did.&rdquo; He twisted his moustache, evidently proud of his
      reputation. &ldquo;Well, maybe I did see red for a day or two&mdash;but I&rsquo;m a
      philosopher, first and last. Before I went into banking I&rsquo;d made and lost
      two fortunes out West. Well, how did I build ’em up again? Not by shooting
      anybody even myself. By just buckling to, and beginning all over again.
      That&rsquo;s how... and that&rsquo;s what I am doing now. Beginning all over again.&rdquo;
       His voice dropped from boastfulness to a note of wistful melancholy, the
      look of strained jauntiness fell from his face like a mask, and for an
      instant she saw the real man, old, ruined, lonely. Yes, that was it: he
      was lonely, desperately lonely, foundering in such deep seas of solitude
      that any presence out of the past was like a spar to which he clung.
      Whatever he knew or guessed of the part she had played in his disaster, it
      was not callousness that had made him greet her with such forgiving
      warmth, but the same sense of smallness, insignificance and isolation
      which perpetually hung like a cold fog on her own horizon. Suddenly she
      too felt old&mdash;old and unspeakably tired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been nice seeing you, Nelson. But now I must be getting home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He offered no objection, but asked for the bill, resumed his jaunty air
      while he scattered largesse among the waiters, and sauntered out behind
      her after calling for a taxi.
    </p>
    <p>
      They drove off in silence. Susy was thinking: &ldquo;And Clarissa?&rdquo; but dared
      not ask. Vanderlyn lit a cigarette, hummed a dance-tune, and stared out of
      the window. Suddenly she felt his hand on hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Susy&mdash;do you ever see her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See&mdash;Ellie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded, without turning toward her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not often... sometimes....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you do, for God&rsquo;s sake tell her I&rsquo;m happy... happy as a king... tell
      her you could see for yourself that I was....&rdquo; His voice broke in a little
      gasp. &ldquo;I... I&rsquo;ll be damned if... if she shall ever be unhappy about me...
      if I can help it....&rdquo; The cigarette dropped from his fingers, and with a
      sob he covered his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, poor Nelson&mdash;poor Nelson,&rdquo; Susy breathed. While their cab
      rattled across the Place du Carrousel, and over the bridge, he continued
      to sit beside her with hidden face. At last he pulled out a scented
      handkerchief, rubbed his eyes with it, and groped for another cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right! Tell her that, will you, Susy? There are some of our old
      times I don&rsquo;t suppose I shall ever forget; but they make me feel kindly to
      her, and not angry. I didn&rsquo;t know it would be so, beforehand&mdash;but it
      is.... And now the thing&rsquo;s settled I&rsquo;m as right as a trivet, and you can
      tell her so.... Look here, Susy...&rdquo; he caught her by the arm as the taxi
      drew up at her hotel.... &ldquo;Tell her I understand, will you? I&rsquo;d rather like
      her to know that....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell her, Nelson,&rdquo; she promised; and climbed the stairs alone to her
      dreary room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Susy&rsquo;s one fear was that Strefford, when he returned the next day, should
      treat their talk of the previous evening as a fit of &ldquo;nerves&rdquo; to be jested
      away. He might, indeed, resent her behaviour too deeply to seek to see her
      at once; but his easygoing modern attitude toward conduct and convictions
      made that improbable. She had an idea that what he had most minded was her
      dropping so unceremoniously out of the Embassy Dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, after all, why should she see him again? She had had enough of
      explanations during the last months to have learned how seldom they
      explain anything. If the other person did not understand at the first
      word, at the first glance even, subsequent elucidations served only to
      deepen the obscurity. And she wanted above all&mdash;and especially since
      her hour with Nelson Vanderlyn&mdash;to keep herself free, aloof, to
      retain her hold on her precariously recovered self. She sat down and wrote
      to Strefford&mdash;and the letter was only a little less painful to write
      than the one she had despatched to Nick. It was not that her own feelings
      were in any like measure engaged; but because, as the decision to give up
      Strefford affirmed itself, she remembered only his kindness, his
      forbearance, his good humour, and all the other qualities she had always
      liked in him; and because she felt ashamed of the hesitations which must
      cause him so much pain and humiliation. Yes: humiliation chiefly. She knew
      that what she had to say would hurt his pride, in whatever way she framed
      her renunciation; and her pen wavered, hating its task. Then she
      remembered Vanderlyn&rsquo;s words about his wife: &ldquo;There are some of our old
      times I don&rsquo;t suppose I shall ever forget&mdash;&rdquo; and a phrase of Grace
      Fulmer&rsquo;s that she had but half grasped at the time: &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t been
      married long enough to understand how trifling such things seem in the
      balance of one&rsquo;s memories.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here were two people who had penetrated farther than she into the
      labyrinth of the wedded state, and struggled through some of its thorniest
      passages; and yet both, one consciously, the other half-unaware, testified
      to the mysterious fact which was already dawning on her: that the
      influence of a marriage begun in mutual understanding is too deep not to
      reassert itself even in the moment of flight and denial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The real reason is that you&rsquo;re not Nick&rdquo; was what she would have said to
      Strefford if she had dared to set down the bare truth; and she knew that,
      whatever she wrote, he was too acute not to read that into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll think it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m still in love with Nick... and perhaps I am.
      But even if I were, the difference doesn&rsquo;t seem to lie there, after all,
      but deeper, in things we&rsquo;ve shared that seem to be meant to outlast love,
      or to change it into something different.&rdquo; If she could have hoped to make
      Strefford understand that, the letter would have been easy enough to write&mdash;but
      she knew just at what point his imagination would fail, in what obvious
      and superficial inferences it would rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Streff&mdash;poor me!&rdquo; she thought as she sealed the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      After she had despatched it a sense of blankness descended on her. She had
      succeeded in driving from her mind all vain hesitations, doubts, returns
      upon herself: her healthy system naturally rejected them. But they left a
      queer emptiness in which her thoughts rattled about as thoughts might, she
      supposed, in the first moments after death&mdash;before one got used to
      it. To get used to being dead: that seemed to be her immediate business.
      And she felt such a novice at it&mdash;felt so horribly alive! How had
      those others learned to do without living? Nelson&mdash;well, he was still
      in the throes; and probably never would understand, or be able to
      communicate, the lesson when he had mastered it. But Grace Fulmer&mdash;she
      suddenly remembered that Grace was in Paris, and set forth to find her.
    </p>


<h3>XXIV.</h3>

    <p>
      <span class="smcap">Nick Lansing</span> had walked out a long way into the Campagna. His hours were
      seldom his own, for both Mr. and Mrs. Hicks were becoming more and more
      addicted to sudden and somewhat imperious demands upon his time; but on
      this occasion he had simply slipped away after luncheon, and taking the
      tram to the Porta Salaria, had wandered on thence in the direction of the
      Ponte Nomentano.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wanted to get away and think; but now that he had done it the business
      proved as unfruitful as everything he had put his hand to since he had
      left Venice. Think&mdash;think about what? His future seemed to him a
      negligible matter since he had received, two months earlier, the few lines
      in which Susy had asked him for her freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter had been a shock&mdash;though he had fancied himself so
      prepared for it&mdash;yet it had also, in another sense, been a relief,
      since, now that at last circumstances compelled him to write to her, they
      also told him what to say. And he had said it as briefly and simply as
      possible, telling her that he would put no obstacle in the way of her
      release, that he held himself at her lawyer&rsquo;s disposal to answer any
      further communication&mdash;and that he would never forget their days
      together, or cease to bless her for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was all. He gave his Roman banker&rsquo;s address, and waited for another
      letter; but none came. Probably the &ldquo;formalities,&rdquo; whatever they were,
      took longer than he had supposed; and being in no haste to recover his own
      liberty, he did not try to learn the cause of the delay. From that moment,
      however, he considered himself virtually free, and ceased, by the same
      token, to take any interest in his own future. His life seemed as flat as
      a convalescent&rsquo;s first days after the fever has dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only thing he was sure of was that he was not going to remain in the
      Hickses&rsquo; employ: when they left Rome for Central Asia he had no intention
      of accompanying them. The part of Mr. Buttles&rsquo; successor was becoming
      daily more intolerable to him, for the very reasons that had probably made
      it most gratifying to Mr. Buttles. To be treated by Mr. and Mrs. Hicks as
      a paid oracle, a paraded and petted piece of property, was a good deal
      more distasteful than he could have imagined any relation with these
      kindly people could be. And since their aspirations had become frankly
      social he found his task, if easier, yet far less congenial than during
      his first months with them. He preferred patiently explaining to Mrs.
      Hicks, for the hundredth time, that Sassanian and Saracenic were not
      interchangeable terms, to unravelling for her the genealogies of her
      titled guests, and reminding her, when she &ldquo;seated&rdquo; her dinner-parties,
      that Dukes ranked higher than Princes. No&mdash;the job was decidedly
      intolerable; and he would have to look out for another means of earning
      his living. But that was not what he had really got away to think about.
      He knew he should never starve; he had even begun to believe again in his
      book. What he wanted to think of was Susy&mdash;or rather, it was Susy
      that he could not help thinking of, on whatever train of thought he set
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again and again he fancied he had established a truce with the past: had
      come to terms&mdash;the terms of defeat and failure with that bright enemy
      called happiness. And, in truth, he had reached the point of definitely
      knowing that he could never return to the kind of life that he and Susy
      had embarked on. It had been the tragedy, of their relation that loving
      her roused in him ideals she could never satisfy. He had fallen in love
      with her because she was, like himself, amused, unprejudiced and
      disenchanted; and he could not go on loving her unless she ceased to be
      all these things. From that circle there was no issue, and in it he
      desperately revolved.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he had not heard such persistent rumours of her re-marriage to Lord
      Altringham he might have tried to see her again; but, aware of the danger
      and the hopelessness of a meeting, he was, on the whole, glad to have a
      reason for avoiding it. Such, at least, he honestly supposed to be his
      state of mind until he found himself, as on this occasion, free to follow
      out his thought to its end. That end, invariably, was Susy; not the bundle
      of qualities and defects into which his critical spirit had tried to sort
      her out, but the soft blur of identity, of personality, of eyes, hair,
      mouth, laugh, tricks of speech and gesture, that were all so solely and
      profoundly her own, and yet so mysteriously independent of what she might
      do, say, think, in crucial circumstances. He remembered her once saying to
      him: &ldquo;After all, you were right when you wanted me to be your mistress,&rdquo;
       and the indignant stare of incredulity with which he had answered her. Yet
      in these hours it was the palpable image of her that clung closest, till,
      as invariably happened, his vision came full circle, and feeling her on
      his breast he wanted her also in his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well&mdash;such all-encompassing loves were the rarest of human
      experiences; he smiled at his presumption in wanting no other. Wearily he
      turned, and tramped homeward through the winter twilight....
    </p>
    <p>
      At the door of the hotel he ran across the Prince of Teutoburg&rsquo;s
      aide-de-camp. They had not met for some days, and Nick had a vague feeling
      that if the Prince&rsquo;s matrimonial designs took definite shape he himself
      was not likely, after all, to be their chosen exponent. He had surprised,
      now and then, a certain distrustful coldness under the Princess Mother&rsquo;s
      cordial glance, and had concluded that she perhaps suspected him of being
      an obstacle to her son&rsquo;s aspirations. He had no idea of playing that part,
      but was not sorry to appear to; for he was sincerely attached to Coral
      Hicks, and hoped for her a more human fate than that of becoming Prince
      Anastasius&rsquo;s consort.
    </p>
    <p>
      This evening, however, he was struck by the beaming alacrity of the
      aide-de-camp&rsquo;s greeting. Whatever cloud had hung between them had lifted:
      the Teutoburg clan, for one reason or another, no longer feared or
      distrusted him. The change was conveyed in a mere hand-pressure, a brief
      exchange of words, for the aide-de-camp was hastening after a well-known
      dowager of the old Roman world, whom he helped into a large coronetted
      brougham which looked as if it had been extracted, for some ceremonial
      purpose, from a museum of historic vehicles. And in an instant it flashed
      on Lansing that this lady had been the person chosen to lay the Prince&rsquo;s
      offer at Miss Hicks&rsquo;s feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The discovery piqued him; and instead of making straight for his own room
      he went up to Mrs. Hicks&rsquo;s drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was empty, but traces of elaborate tea pervaded it, and an
      immense bouquet of stiff roses lay on the centre table. As he turned away,
      Eldorada Tooker, flushed and tear-stained, abruptly entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Lansing&mdash;we were looking everywhere for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looking for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Coral especially... she wants to see you. She wants you to come to
      her own sitting-room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She led him across the ante-chamber and down the passage to the separate
      suite which Miss Hicks inhabited. On the threshold Eldorada gasped out
      emotionally: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find her looking lovely&mdash;&rdquo; and jerked away with
      a sob as he entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coral Hicks was never lovely: but she certainly looked unusually handsome.
      Perhaps it was the long dress of black velvet which, outlined against a
      shaded lamp, made her strong build seem slenderer, or perhaps the slight
      flush on her dusky cheek: a bloom of womanhood hung upon her which she
      made no effort to dissemble. Indeed, it was one of her originalities that
      she always gravely and courageously revealed the utmost of whatever mood
      possessed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How splendid you look!&rdquo; he said, smiling at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She threw her head back and gazed him straight in the eyes. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s going
      to be my future job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To look splendid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And wear a crown?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And wear a crown....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They continued to consider each other without speaking. Nick&rsquo;s heart
      contracted with pity and perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Coral&mdash;it&rsquo;s not decided?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She scrutinized him for a last penetrating moment; then she looked away.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m never long deciding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated, choking with contradictory impulses, and afraid to formulate
      any, lest they should either mislead or pain her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo; he questioned lamely; and instantly perceived
      his blunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down, and looked up at him under brooding lashes&mdash;had he ever
      noticed the thickness of her lashes before?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would it have made any difference if I had told you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any difference&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down by me,&rdquo; she commanded. &ldquo;I want to talk to you. You can say now
      whatever you might have said sooner. I&rsquo;m not married yet: I&rsquo;m still free.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t given your answer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter if I have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The retort frightened him with the glimpse of what she still expected of
      him, and what he was still so unable to give.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That means you&rsquo;ve said yes?&rdquo; he pursued, to gain time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes or no&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t matter. I had to say something. What I want is
      your advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the eleventh hour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or the twelfth.&rdquo; She paused. &ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo; she questioned, with a
      sudden accent of helplessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her as helplessly. He could not say: &ldquo;Ask yourself&mdash;ask
      your parents.&rdquo; Her next word would sweep away such frail hypocrisies. Her
      &ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo; meant &ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; and he knew it, and
      knew that she knew it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a bad person to give any one matrimonial advice,&rdquo; he began, with a
      strained smile; &ldquo;but I had such a different vision for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of a vision?&rdquo; She was merciless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Merely what people call happiness, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;People call&rsquo;&mdash;you see you don&rsquo;t believe in it yourself! Well,
      neither do I&mdash;in that form, at any rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He considered. &ldquo;I believe in trying for it&mdash;even if the trying&rsquo;s the
      best of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve tried, and failed. And I&rsquo;m twenty-two, and I never was young.
      I suppose I haven&rsquo;t enough imagination.&rdquo; She drew a deep breath. &ldquo;Now I
      want something different.&rdquo; She appeared to search for the word. &ldquo;I want to
      be&mdash;prominent,&rdquo; she declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prominent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She reddened swarthily. &ldquo;Oh, you smile&mdash;you think it&rsquo;s ridiculous: it
      doesn&rsquo;t seem worth while to you. That&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;ve always had all
      those things. But I haven&rsquo;t. I know what father pushed up from, and I want
      to push up as high again&mdash;higher. No, I haven&rsquo;t got much imagination.
      I&rsquo;ve always liked Facts. And I find I shall like the fact of being a
      Princess&mdash;choosing the people I associate with, and being up above
      all these European grandees that father and mother bow down to, though
      they think they despise them. You can be up above these people by just
      being yourself; you know how. But I need a platform&mdash;a sky-scraper.
      Father and mother slaved to give me my education. They thought education
      was the important thing; but, since we&rsquo;ve all three of us got mediocre
      minds, it has just landed us among mediocre people. Don&rsquo;t you suppose I
      see through all the sham science and sham art and sham everything we&rsquo;re
      surrounded with? That&rsquo;s why I want to buy a place at the very top, where I
      shall be powerful enough to get about me the people I want, the big
      people, the right people, and to help them I want to promote culture, like
      those Renaissance women you&rsquo;re always talking about. I want to do it for
      Apex City; do you understand? And for father and mother too. I want all
      those titles carved on my tombstone. They&rsquo;re facts, anyhow! Don&rsquo;t laugh at
      me....&rdquo; She broke off with one of her clumsy smiles, and moved away from
      him to the other end of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat looking at her with a curious feeling of admiration. Her harsh
      positivism was like a tonic to his disenchanted mood, and he thought:
      &ldquo;What a pity!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aloud he said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel like laughing at you. You&rsquo;re a great woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I shall be a great Princess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;but you might have been something so much greater!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her face flamed again. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood up involuntarily, and drew near her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re the only man with whom I can imagine the other kind of
      greatness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It moved him&mdash;moved him unexpectedly. He got as far as saying to
      himself: &ldquo;Good God, if she were not so hideously rich&mdash;&rdquo; and then of
      yielding for a moment to the persuasive vision of all that he and she
      might do with those very riches which he dreaded. After all, there was
      nothing mean in her ideals they were hard and material, in keeping with
      her primitive and massive person; but they had a certain grim nobility.
      And when she spoke of &ldquo;the other kind of greatness&rdquo; he knew that she
      understood what she was talking of, and was not merely saying something to
      draw him on, to get him to commit himself. There was not a drop of guile
      in her, except that which her very honesty distilled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The other kind of greatness?&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, isn&rsquo;t that what you said happiness was? I wanted to be happy... but
      one can&rsquo;t choose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went up to her. &ldquo;No, one can&rsquo;t choose. And how can anyone give you
      happiness who hasn&rsquo;t got it himself?&rdquo; He took her hands, feeling how
      large, muscular and voluntary they were, even as they melted in his palms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor Coral, of what use can I ever be to you? What you need is to be
      loved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew back and gave him one of her straight strong glances: &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she
      said gallantly, &ldquo;but just to love.&rdquo;

      PART III
    </h2>

    <h3>
      XXV.
    </h3>

    <p>
      <span class="smcap">In</span> the persistent drizzle of a Paris winter morning Susy Lansing walked
      back alone from the school at which she had just deposited the four eldest
      Fulmers to the little house in Passy where, for the last two months, she
      had been living with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had on ready-made boots, an old waterproof and a last year&rsquo;s hat; but
      none of these facts disturbed her, though she took no particular pride in
      them. The truth was that she was too busy to think much about them. Since
      she had assumed the charge of the Fulmer children, in the absence of both
      their parents in Italy, she had had to pass through such an arduous
      apprenticeship of motherhood that every moment of her waking hours was
      packed with things to do at once, and other things to remember to do
      later. There were only five Fulmers; but at times they were like an army
      with banners, and their power of self-multiplication was equalled only by
      the manner in which they could dwindle, vanish, grow mute, and become as
      it were a single tumbled brown head bent over a book in some corner of the
      house in which nobody would ever have thought of hunting for them&mdash;and
      which, of course, were it the bonne&rsquo;s room in the attic, or the
      subterranean closet where the trunks were kept, had been singled out by
      them for that very reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      These changes from ubiquity to invisibility would have seemed to Susy, a
      few months earlier, one of the most maddening of many characteristics not
      calculated to promote repose. But now she felt differently. She had grown
      interested in her charges, and the search for a clue to their methods,
      whether tribal or individual, was as exciting to her as the development of
      a detective story.
    </p>
    <p>
      What interested her most in the whole stirring business was the discovery
      that they had a method. These little creatures, pitched upward into
      experience on the tossing waves of their parents&rsquo; agitated lives, had
      managed to establish a rough-and-ready system of self-government. Junie,
      the eldest (the one who already chose her mother&rsquo;s hats, and tried to put
      order in her wardrobe) was the recognized head of the state. At twelve she
      knew lots of things which her mother had never thoroughly learned, and
      Susy, her temporary mother, had never even guessed at: she spoke with
      authority on all vital subjects, from castor-oil to flannel under-clothes,
      from the fair sharing of stamps or marbles to the number of helpings of
      rice-pudding or jam which each child was entitled to.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was hardly any appeal from her verdict; yet each of her subjects
      revolved in his or her own orbit of independence, according to laws which
      Junie acknowledged and respected; and the interpreting of this mysterious
      charter of rights and privileges had not been without difficulty for Susy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides this, there were material difficulties to deal with. The six of
      them, and the breathless bonne who cooked and slaved for them all, had but
      a slim budget to live on; and, as Junie remarked, you&rsquo;d have thought the
      boys ate their shoes, the way they vanished. They ate, certainly, a great
      deal else, and mostly of a nourishing and expensive kind. They had
      definite views about the amount and quality of their food, and were
      capable of concerted rebellion when Susy&rsquo;s catering fell beneath their
      standard. All this made her life a hurried and harassing business, but
      never&mdash;what she had most feared it would be a dull or depressing one.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not, she owned to herself, that the society of the Fulmer children
      had roused in her any abstract passion for the human young. She knew&mdash;had
      known since Nick&rsquo;s first kiss&mdash;how she would love any child of his
      and hers; and she had cherished poor little Clarissa Vanderlyn with a
      shrinking and wistful solicitude. But in these rough young Fulmers she
      took a positive delight, and for reasons that were increasingly clear to
      her. It was because, in the first place, they were all intelligent; and
      because their intelligence had been fed only on things worth caring for.
      However inadequate Grace Fulmer&rsquo;s bringing-up of her increasing tribe had
      been, they had heard in her company nothing trivial or dull: good music,
      good books and good talk had been their daily food, and if at times they
      stamped and roared and crashed about like children unblessed by such
      privileges, at others they shone with the light of poetry and spoke with
      the voice of wisdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      That had been Susy&rsquo;s discovery: for the first time she was among awakening
      minds which had been wakened only to beauty. From their cramped and
      uncomfortable household Grace and Nat Fulmer had managed to keep out mean
      envies, vulgar admirations, shabby discontents; above all the din and
      confusion the great images of beauty had brooded, like those ancestral
      figures that stood apart on their shelf in the poorest Roman households.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, the task she had undertaken for want of a better gave Susy no sense of
      a missed vocation: &ldquo;mothering&rdquo; on a large scale would never, she
      perceived, be her job. Rather it gave her, in odd ways, the sense of being
      herself mothered, of taking her first steps in the life of immaterial
      values which had begun to seem so much more substantial than any she had
      known.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day when she had gone to Grace Fulmer for counsel and comfort she
      had little guessed that they would come to her in this form. She had found
      her friend, more than ever distracted and yet buoyant, riding the large
      untidy waves of her life with the splashed ease of an amphibian. Grace was
      probably the only person among Susy&rsquo;s friends who could have understood
      why she could not make up her mind to marry Altringham; but at the moment
      Grace was too much absorbed in her own problems to pay much attention to
      her friend&rsquo;s, and, according to her wont, she immediately &ldquo;unpacked&rdquo; her
      difficulties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nat was not getting what she had hoped out of his European opportunity.
      Oh, she was enough of an artist herself to know that there must be fallow
      periods&mdash;that the impact of new impressions seldom produced immediate
      results. She had allowed for all that. But her past experience of Nat&rsquo;s
      moods had taught her to know just when he was assimilating, when
      impressions were fructifying in him. And now they were not, and he knew it
      as well as she did. There had been too much rushing about, too much
      excitement and sterile flattery... Mrs. Melrose? Well, yes, for a while...
      the trip to Spain had been a love-journey, no doubt. Grace spoke calmly,
      but the lines of her face sharpened: she had suffered, oh horribly, at his
      going to Spain without her. Yet she couldn&rsquo;t, for the children&rsquo;s sake,
      afford to miss the big sum that Ursula Gillow had given her for her
      fortnight at Ruan. And her playing had struck people, and led, on the way
      back, to two or three profitable engagements in private houses in London.
      Fashionable society had made &ldquo;a little fuss&rdquo; about her, and it had
      surprised and pleased Nat, and given her a new importance in his eyes. &ldquo;He
      was beginning to forget that I wasn&rsquo;t only a nursery-maid, and it&rsquo;s been a
      good thing for him to be reminded... but the great thing is that with what
      I&rsquo;ve earned he and I can go off to southern Italy and Sicily for three
      months. You know I know how to manage... and, alone with me, Nat will
      settle down to work: to observing, feeling, soaking things in. It&rsquo;s the
      only way. Mrs. Melrose wants to take him, to pay all the expenses
      again&mdash;well she shan&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ll pay them.&rdquo; Her worn cheek flushed with
      triumph. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll see what wonders will come of it.... Only there&rsquo;s the
      problem of the children. Junie quite agrees that we can&rsquo;t take them....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon she had unfolded her idea. If Susy was at a loose end, and hard
      up, why shouldn&rsquo;t she take charge of the children while their parents were
      in Italy? For three months at most&mdash;Grace could promise it shouldn&rsquo;t be
      longer. They couldn&rsquo;t pay her much, of course, but at least she would be
      lodged and fed. &ldquo;And, you know, it will end by interesting you&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      sure it will,&rdquo; the mother concluded, her irrepressible hopefulness rising
      even to this height, while Susy stood before her with a hesitating smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take care of five Fulmers for three months! The prospect cowed her. If
      there had been only Junie and Geordie, the oldest and youngest of the
      band, she might have felt less hesitation. But there was Nat, the second
      in age, whose motor-horn had driven her and Nick out to the hill-side on
      their fatal day at the Fulmers&rsquo; and there were the twins, Jack and Peggy,
      of whom she had kept memories almost equally disquieting. To rule this
      uproarious tribe would be a sterner business than trying to beguile
      Clarissa Vanderlyn&rsquo;s ladylike leisure; and she would have refused on the
      spot, as she had refused once before, if the only possible alternatives
      had not come to seem so much less bearable, and if Junie, called in for
      advice, and standing there, small, plain and competent, had not said in
      her quiet grown-up voice: &ldquo;Oh, yes, I&rsquo;m sure Mrs. Lansing and I can manage
      while you&rsquo;re away&mdash;especially if she reads aloud well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reads aloud well! The stipulation had enchanted Susy. She had never before
      known children who cared to be read aloud to; she remembered with a shiver
      her attempts to interest Clarissa in anything but gossip and the fashions,
      and the tone in which the child had said, showing Strefford&rsquo;s trinket to
      her father: &ldquo;Because I said I&rsquo;d rather have it than a book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And here were children who consented to be left for three months by their
      parents, but on condition that a good reader was provided for them!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well&mdash;I will! But what shall I be expected to read to you?&rdquo; she
      had gaily questioned; and Junie had answered, after one of her sober
      pauses of reflection: &ldquo;The little ones like nearly everything; but Nat and
      I want poetry particularly, because if we read it to ourselves we so often
      pronounce the puzzling words wrong, and then it sounds so horrid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I hope I shall pronounce them right,&rdquo; Susy murmured, stricken with
      self-distrust and humility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apparently she did; for her reading was a success, and even the twins and
      Geordie, once they had grown used to her, seemed to prefer a ringing page
      of Henry V, or the fairy scenes from the Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream, to their
      own more specialized literature, though that had also at times to be
      provided.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were, in fact, no lulls in her life with the Fulmers; but its
      commotions seemed to Susy less meaningless, and therefore less fatiguing,
      than those that punctuated the existence of people like Altringham, Ursula
      Gillow, Ellie Vanderlyn and their train; and the noisy uncomfortable
      little house at Passy was beginning to greet her with the eyes of home
      when she returned there after her tramps to and from the children&rsquo;s
      classes. At any rate she had the sense of doing something useful and even
      necessary, and of earning her own keep, though on so modest a scale; and
      when the children were in their quiet mood, and demanded books or music
      (or, even, on one occasion, at the surprising Junie&rsquo;s instigation, a
      collective visit to the Louvre, where they recognized the most unlikely
      pictures, and the two elders emitted startling technical judgments, and
      called their companion&rsquo;s attention to details she had not observed); on
      these occasions, Susy had a surprised sense of being drawn back into her
      brief life with Nick, or even still farther and deeper, into those visions
      of Nick&rsquo;s own childhood on which the trivial later years had heaped their
      dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was curious to think that if he and she had remained together, and she
      had had a child&mdash;the vision used to come to her, in her sleepless
      hours, when she looked at little Geordie, in his cot by her bed&mdash;their
      life together might have been very much like the life she was now leading,
      a small obscure business to the outer world, but to themselves how wide
      and deep and crowded!
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not bear, at that moment, the thought of giving up this mystic
      relation to the life she had missed. In spite of the hurry and fatigue of
      her days, the shabbiness and discomfort of everything, and the hours when
      the children were as &ldquo;horrid&rdquo; as any other children, and turned a
      conspiracy of hostile faces to all her appeals; in spite of all this she
      did not want to give them up, and had decided, when their parents
      returned, to ask to go back to America with them. Perhaps, if Nat&rsquo;s
      success continued, and Grace was able to work at her music, they would
      need a kind of governess-companion. At any rate, she could picture no
      future less distasteful.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not sent to Mr. Spearman Nick&rsquo;s answer to her letter. In the
      interval between writing to him and receiving his reply she had broken
      with Strefford; she had therefore no object in seeking her freedom. If
      Nick wanted his, he knew he had only to ask for it; and his silence, as
      the weeks passed, woke a faint hope in her. The hope flamed high when she
      read one day in the newspapers a vague but evidently &ldquo;inspired&rdquo; allusion
      to the possibility of an alliance between his Serene Highness the reigning
      Prince of Teutoburg-Waldhain and Miss Coral Hicks of Apex City; it sank to
      ashes when, a few days later, her eye lit on a paragraph wherein Mr. and
      Mrs. Mortimer Hicks &ldquo;requested to state&rdquo; that there was no truth in the
      report.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the foundation of these two statements Susy raised one watch-tower of
      hope after another, feverish edifices demolished or rebuilt by every
      chance hint from the outer world wherein Nick&rsquo;s name figured with the
      Hickses&rsquo;. And still, as the days passed and she heard nothing, either from
      him or from her lawyer, her flag continued to fly from the quaking
      structures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apart from the custody of the children there was indeed little to distract
      her mind from these persistent broodings. She winced sometimes at the
      thought of the ease with which her fashionable friends had let her drop
      out of sight. In the perpetual purposeless rush of their days, the
      feverish making of winter plans, hurrying off to the Riviera or St.
      Moritz, Egypt or New York, there was no time to hunt up the vanished or to
      wait for the laggard. Had they learned that she had broken her
      &ldquo;engagement&rdquo; (how she hated the word!) to Strefford, and had the fact gone
      about that she was once more only a poor hanger-on, to be taken up when it
      was convenient, and ignored in the intervals? She did not know; though she
      fancied Strefford&rsquo;s newly-developed pride would prevent his revealing to
      any one what had passed between them. For several days after her abrupt
      flight he had made no sign; and though she longed to write and ask his
      forgiveness she could not find the words. Finally it was he who wrote: a
      short note, from Altringham, typical of all that was best in the old
      Strefford. He had gone down to Altringham, he told her, to think quietly
      over their last talk, and try to understand what she had been driving at.
      He had to own that he couldn&rsquo;t; but that, he supposed, was the very head
      and front of his offending. Whatever he had done to displease her, he was
      sorry for; but he asked, in view of his invincible ignorance, to be
      allowed not to regard his offence as a cause for a final break. The
      possibility of that, he found, would make him even more unhappy than he
      had foreseen; as she knew, his own happiness had always been his first
      object in life, and he therefore begged her to suspend her decision a
      little longer. He expected to be in Paris within another two months, and
      before arriving he would write again, and ask her to see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter moved her but did not make her waver. She simply wrote that she
      was touched by his kindness, and would willingly see him if he came to
      Paris later; though she was bound to tell him that she had not yet changed
      her mind, and did not believe it would promote his happiness to have her
      try to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not reply to this, and there was nothing further to keep her
      thoughts from revolving endlessly about her inmost hopes and fears.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the rainy afternoon in question, tramping home from the &ldquo;cours&rdquo; (to
      which she was to return at six), she had said to herself that it was two
      months that very day since Nick had known she was ready to release him&mdash;and
      that after such a delay he was not likely to take any further steps. The
      thought filled her with a vague ecstasy. She had had to fix an arbitrary
      date as the term of her anguish, and she had fixed that one; and behold
      she was justified. For what could his silence mean but that he too....
    </p>
    <p>
      On the hall-table lay a typed envelope with the Paris postage-mark. She
      opened it carelessly, and saw that the letter-head bore Mr. Spearman&rsquo;s
      office address. The words beneath spun round before her eyes.... &ldquo;Has
      notified us that he is at your disposal... carry out your wishes...
      arriving in Paris... fix an appointment with his lawyers....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nick&mdash;it was Nick the words were talking of! It was the fact of
      Nick&rsquo;s return to Paris that was being described in those preposterous
      terms! She sank down on the bench beside the dripping umbrella-stand and
      stared vacantly before her. It had fallen at last&mdash;this blow in which
      she now saw that she had never really believed! And yet she had imagined
      she was prepared for it, had expected it, was already planning her future
      life in view of it&mdash;an effaced impersonal life in the service of
      somebody else&rsquo;s children&mdash;when, in reality, under that thin surface
      of abnegation and acceptance, all the old hopes had been smouldering
      red-hot in their ashes! What was the use of any self-discipline, any
      philosophy, any experience, if the lawless self underneath could in an
      instant consume them like tinder?
    </p>
    <p>
      She tried to collect herself&mdash;to understand what had happened. Nick
      was coming to Paris&mdash;coming not to see her but to consult his lawyer!
      It meant, of course, that he had definitely resolved to claim his freedom;
      and that, if he had made up his mind to this final step, after more than
      six months of inaction and seeming indifference, it could be only because
      something unforeseen and decisive had happened to him. Feverishly, she put
      together again the stray scraps of gossip and the newspaper paragraphs
      that had reached her in the last months. It was evident that Miss Hicks&rsquo;s
      projected marriage with the Prince of Teutoburg-Waldhain had been broken
      off at the last moment; and broken off because she intended to marry Nick.
      The announcement of his arrival in Paris and the publication of Mr. and
      Mrs. Hicks&rsquo;s formal denial of their daughter&rsquo;s betrothal coincided too
      closely to admit of any other inference. Susy tried to grasp the reality
      of these assembled facts, to picture to herself their actual tangible
      results. She thought of Coral Hicks bearing the name of Mrs. Nick Lansing&mdash;her
      name, Susy&rsquo;s own!&mdash;and entering drawing-rooms with Nick in her wake,
      gaily welcomed by the very people who, a few months before, had welcomed
      Susy with the same warmth. In spite of Nick&rsquo;s growing dislike of society,
      and Coral&rsquo;s attitude of intellectual superiority, their wealth would
      fatally draw them back into the world to which Nick was attached by all
      his habits and associations. And no doubt it would amuse him to re-enter
      that world as a dispenser of hospitality, to play the part of host where
      he had so long been a guest; just as Susy had once fancied it would amuse
      her to re-enter it as Lady Altringham.... But, try as she would, now that
      the reality was so close on her, she could not visualize it or relate it
      to herself. The mere juxtaposition of the two names&mdash;Coral, Nick&mdash;which
      in old times she had so often laughingly coupled, now produced a blur in
      her brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      She continued to sit helplessly beside the hall-table, the tears running
      down her cheeks. The appearance of the bonne aroused her. Her youngest
      charge, Geordie, had been feverish for a day or two; he was better, but
      still confined to the nursery, and he had heard Susy unlock the
      house-door, and could not imagine why she had not come straight up to him.
      He now began to manifest his indignation in a series of racking howls, and
      Susy, shaken out of her trance, dropped her cloak and umbrella and hurried
      up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that child!&rdquo; she groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the Fulmer roof there was little time or space for the indulgence of
      private sorrows. From morning till night there was always some immediate
      practical demand on one&rsquo;s attention; and Susy was beginning to see how, in
      contracted households, children may play a part less romantic but not less
      useful than that assigned to them in fiction, through the mere fact of
      giving their parents no leisure to dwell on irremediable grievances.
      Though her own apprenticeship to family life had been so short, she had
      already acquired the knack of rapid mental readjustment, and as she
      hurried up to the nursery her private cares were dispelled by a dozen
      problems of temperature, diet and medicine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such readjustment was of course only momentary; yet each time it happened
      it seemed to give her more firmness and flexibility of temper. &ldquo;What a
      child I was myself six months ago!&rdquo; she thought, wondering that Nick&rsquo;s
      influence, and the tragedy of their parting, should have done less to
      mature and steady her than these few weeks in a house full of children.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pacifying Geordie was not easy, for he had long since learned to use his
      grievances as a pretext for keeping the offender at his beck with a
      continuous supply of stories, songs and games. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better be careful
      never to put yourself in the wrong with Geordie,&rdquo; the astute Junie had
      warned Susy at the outset, &ldquo;because he&rsquo;s got such a memory, and he won&rsquo;t
      make it up with you till you&rsquo;ve told him every fairy-tale he&rsquo;s ever heard
      before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But on this occasion, as soon as he saw her, Geordie&rsquo;s indignation melted.
      She was still in the doorway, compunctious, abject and racking her dazed
      brain for his favourite stories, when she saw, by the smoothing out of his
      mouth and the sudden serenity of his eyes, that he was going to give her
      the delicious but not wholly reassuring shock of being a good boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thoughtfully he examined her face as she knelt down beside the cot; then
      he poked out a finger and pressed it on her tearful cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Susy got a pain too,&rdquo; he said, putting his arms about her; and as
      she hugged him close, he added philosophically: &ldquo;Tell Geordie a new story,
      darling, and you&rsquo;ll forget all about it.&rdquo;
     </p>


<h3>XXVI.</h3>

    <p>
      <span class="smcap">Nick Lansing</span> arrived in Paris two days after his lawyer had announced his
      coming to Mr. Spearman.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had left Rome with the definite purpose of freeing himself and Susy;
      and though he was not pledged to Coral Hicks he had not concealed from her
      the object of his journey. In vain had he tried to rouse in himself any
      sense of interest in his own future. Beyond the need of reaching a
      definite point in his relation to Susy his imagination could not travel.
      But he had been moved by Coral&rsquo;s confession, and his reason told him that
      he and she would probably be happy together, with the temperate happiness
      based on a community of tastes and an enlargement of opportunities. He
      meant, on his return to Rome, to ask her to marry him; and he knew that
      she knew it. Indeed, if he had not spoken before leaving it was with no
      idea of evading his fate, or keeping her longer in suspense, but simply
      because of the strange apathy that had fallen on him since he had received
      Susy&rsquo;s letter. In his incessant self-communings he dressed up this apathy
      as a discretion which forbade his engaging Coral&rsquo;s future till his own was
      assured. But in truth he knew that Coral&rsquo;s future was already engaged, and
      his with it: in Rome the fact had seemed natural and even inevitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Paris, it instantly became the thinnest of unrealities. Not because
      Paris was not Rome, nor because it was Paris; but because hidden away
      somewhere in that vast unheeding labyrinth was the half-forgotten part of
      himself that was Susy.... For weeks, for months past, his mind had been
      saturated with Susy: she had never seemed more insistently near him than
      as their separation lengthened, and the chance of reunion became less
      probable. It was as if a sickness long smouldering in him had broken out
      and become acute, enveloping him in the Nessus-shirt of his memories.
      There were moments when, to his memory, their actual embraces seemed
      perfunctory, accidental, compared with this deep deliberate imprint of her
      soul on his.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet now it had become suddenly different. Now that he was in the same
      place with her, and might at any moment run across her, meet her eyes,
      hear her voice, avoid her hand&mdash;now that penetrating ghost of her
      with which he had been living was sucked back into the shadows, and he
      seemed, for the first time since their parting, to be again in her actual
      presence. He woke to the fact on the morning of his arrival, staring down
      from his hotel window on a street she would perhaps walk through that very
      day, and over a limitless huddle of roofs, one of which covered her at
      that hour. The abruptness of the transition startled him; he had not known
      that her mere geographical nearness would take him by the throat in that
      way. What would it be, then, if she were to walk into the room?
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank heaven that need never happen! He was sufficiently informed as to
      French divorce proceedings to know that they would not necessitate a
      confrontation with his wife; and with ordinary luck, and some precautions,
      he might escape even a distant glimpse of her. He did not mean to remain
      in Paris more than a few days; and during that time it would be easy&mdash;knowing,
      as he did, her tastes and Altringham&rsquo;s&mdash;to avoid the places where she
      was likely to be met. He did not know where she was living, but imagined
      her to be staying with Mrs. Melrose, or some other rich friend, or else
      lodged, in prospective affluence, at the Nouveau Luxe, or in a pretty flat
      of her own. Trust Susy&mdash;ah, the pang of it&mdash;to &ldquo;manage&rdquo;!
    </p>
    <p>
      His first visit was to his lawyer&rsquo;s; and as he walked through the familiar
      streets each approaching face, each distant figure seemed hers. The
      obsession was intolerable. It would not last, of course; but meanwhile he
      had the exposed sense of a fugitive in a nightmare, who feels himself the
      only creature visible in a ghostly and besetting multitude. The eye of the
      metropolis seemed fixed on him in an immense unblinking stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the lawyer&rsquo;s he was told that, as a first step to freedom, he must
      secure a domicile in Paris. He had of course known of this necessity: he
      had seen too many friends through the Divorce Court, in one country or
      another, not to be fairly familiar with the procedure. But the fact
      presented a different aspect as soon as he tried to relate it to himself
      and Susy: it was as though Susy&rsquo;s personality were a medium through which
      events still took on a transfiguring colour. He found the &ldquo;domicile&rdquo; that
      very day: a tawdrily furnished rez-de-chaussee, obviously destined to far
      different uses. And as he sat there, after the concierge had discreetly
      withdrawn with the first quarter&rsquo;s payment in her pocket, and stared about
      him at the vulgar plushy place, he burst out laughing at what it was about
      to figure in the eyes of the law: a Home, and a Home desecrated by his own
      act! The Home in which he and Susy had reared their precarious bliss, and
      seen it crumble at the brutal touch of his unfaithfulness and his cruelty&mdash;for
      he had been told that he must be cruel to her as well as unfaithful! He
      looked at the walls hung with sentimental photogravures, at the shiny
      bronze &ldquo;nudes,&rdquo; the moth-eaten animal-skins and the bedizened bed&mdash;and once
      more the unreality, the impossibility, of all that was happening to him
      entered like a drug into his veins.
    </p>
    <p>
      To rouse himself he stood up, turned the key on the hideous place, and
      returned to his lawyer&rsquo;s. He knew that in the hard dry atmosphere of the
      office the act of giving the address of the flat would restore some kind
      of reality to the phantasmal transaction. And with wonder he watched the
      lawyer, as a matter of course, pencil the street and the number on one of
      the papers enclosed in a folder on which his own name was elaborately
      engrossed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he took leave it occurred to him to ask where Susy was living. At least
      he imagined that it had just occurred to him, and that he was making the
      enquiry merely as a measure of precaution, in order to know what quarter
      of Paris to avoid; but in reality the question had been on his lips since
      he had first entered the office, and lurking in his mind since he had
      emerged from the railway station that morning. The fact of not knowing
      where she lived made the whole of Paris a meaningless unintelligible
      place, as useless to him as the face of a huge clock that has lost its
      hour hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The address in Passy surprised him: he had imagined that she would be
      somewhere in the neighborhood of the Champs Elysees or the Place de
      l&rsquo;Etoile. But probably either Mrs. Melrose or Ellie Vanderlyn had taken a
      house at Passy. Well&mdash;it was something of a relief to know that she
      was so far off. No business called him to that almost suburban region
      beyond the Trocadero, and there was much less chance of meeting her than
      if she had been in the centre of Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      All day he wandered, avoiding the fashionable quarters, the streets in
      which private motors glittered five deep, and furred and feathered
      silhouettes glided from them into tea-rooms, picture-galleries and
      jewellers&rsquo; shops. In some such scenes Susy was no doubt figuring:
      slenderer, finer, vivider, than the other images of clay, but imitating
      their gestures, chattering their jargon, winding her hand among the same
      pearls and sables. He struck away across the Seine, along the quays to the
      Cite, the net-work of old Paris, the great grey vaults of St. Eustache,
      the swarming streets of the Marais. He gazed at monuments dawdled before
      shop-windows, sat in squares and on quays, watching people bargain, argue,
      philander, quarrel, work-girls stroll past in linked bands, beggars whine
      on the bridges, derelicts doze in the pale winter sun, mothers in mourning
      hasten by taking children to school, and street-walkers beat their weary
      rounds before the cafes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day drifted on. Toward evening he began to grow afraid of his
      solitude, and to think of dining at the Nouveau Luxe, or some other
      fashionable restaurant where he would be fairly sure to meet
      acquaintances, and be carried off to a theatre, a boite or a dancing-hall.
      Anything, anything now, to get away from the maddening round of his
      thoughts. He felt the same blank fear of solitude as months ago in
      Genoa.... Even if he were to run across Susy and Altringham, what of it?
      Better get the job over. People had long since ceased to take on tragedy
      airs about divorce: dividing couples dined together to the last, and met
      afterward in each other&rsquo;s houses, happy in the consciousness that their
      respective remarriages had provided two new centres of entertainment. Yet
      most of the couples who took their re-matings so philosophically had
      doubtless had their hour of enchantment, of belief in the immortality of
      loving; whereas he and Susy had simply and frankly entered into a business
      contract for their mutual advantage. The fact gave the last touch of
      incongruity to his agonies and exaltations, and made him appear to himself
      as grotesque and superannuated as the hero of a romantic novel.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood up from a bench on which he had been lounging in the Luxembourg
      gardens, and hailed a taxi. Dusk had fallen, and he meant to go back to
      his hotel, take a rest, and then go out to dine. But instead, he threw
      Susy&rsquo;s address to the driver, and settled down in the cab, resting both
      hands on the knob of his umbrella and staring straight ahead of him as if
      he were accomplishing some tiresome duty that had to be got through with
      before he could turn his mind to more important things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the easiest way,&rdquo; he heard himself say.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the street-corner&mdash;her street-corner&mdash;he stopped the cab, and
      stood motionless while it rattled away. It was a short vague street, much
      farther off than he had expected, and fading away at the farther end in a
      dusky blur of hoardings overhung by trees. A thin rain was beginning to
      fall, and it was already night in this inadequately lit suburban quarter.
      Lansing walked down the empty street. The houses stood a few yards apart,
      with bare-twigged shrubs between, and gates and railings dividing them
      from the pavement. He could not, at first, distinguish their numbers; but
      presently, coming abreast of a street-lamp, he discovered that the small
      shabby facade it illuminated was precisely the one he sought. The
      discovery surprised him. He had imagined that, as frequently happened in
      the outlying quarters of Passy and La Muette, the mean street would lead
      to a stately private hotel, built upon some bowery fragment of an old
      country-place. It was the latest whim of the wealthy to establish
      themselves on these outskirts of Paris, where there was still space for
      verdure; and he had pictured Susy behind some pillared house-front, with
      lights pouring across glossy turf to sculptured gateposts. Instead, he saw
      a six-windowed house, huddled among neighbours of its kind, with the
      family wash fluttering between meagre bushes. The arc-light beat
      ironically on its front, which had the worn look of a tired work-woman&rsquo;s
      face; and Lansing, as he leaned against the opposite railing, vainly tried
      to fit his vision of Susy into so humble a setting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The probable explanation was that his lawyer had given him the wrong
      address; not only the wrong number but the wrong street. He pulled out the
      slip of paper, and was crossing over to decipher it under the lamp, when
      an errand-boy appeared out of the obscurity, and approached the house.
      Nick drew back, and the boy, unlatching the gate, ran up the steps and
      gave the bell a pull.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost immediately the door opened; and there stood Susy, the light full
      upon her, and upon a red-checked child against her shoulder. The space
      behind them was dark, or so dimly lit that it formed a black background to
      her vivid figure. She looked at the errand-boy without surprise, took his
      parcel, and after he had turned away, lingered a moment in the door,
      glancing down the empty street.
    </p>
    <p>
      That moment, to her watcher, seemed quicker than a flash yet as long as a
      life-time. There she was, a stone&rsquo;s throw away, but utterly unconscious of
      his presence: his Susy, the old Susy, and yet a new Susy, curiously
      transformed, transfigured almost, by the new attitude in which he beheld
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first shock of the vision he forgot his surprise at her being in
      such a place, forgot to wonder whose house she was in, or whose was the
      sleepy child in her arms. For an instant she stood out from the blackness
      behind her, and through the veil of the winter night, a thing apart, an
      unconditioned vision, the eternal image of the woman and the child; and in
      that instant everything within him was changed and renewed. His eyes were
      still absorbing her, finding again the familiar curves of her light body,
      noting the thinness of the lifted arm that upheld the little boy, the
      droop of the shoulder he weighed on, the brooding way in which her cheek
      leaned to his even while she looked away; then she drew back, the door
      closed, and the street-lamp again shone on blankness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she&rsquo;s mine!&rdquo; Nick cried, in a fierce triumph of recovery...
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes were so full of her that he shut them to hold in the crowding
      vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      It remained with him, at first, as a complete picture; then gradually it
      broke up into its component parts, the child vanished, the strange house
      vanished, and Susy alone stood before him, his own Susy, only his Susy,
      yet changed, worn, tempered&mdash;older, even&mdash;with sharper shadows
      under the cheek-bones, the brows drawn, the joint of the slim wrist more
      prominent. It was not thus that his memory had evoked her, and he
      recalled, with a remorseful pang, the fact that something in her look, her
      dress, her tired and drooping attitude, suggested poverty, dependence,
      seemed to make her after all a part of the shabby house in which, at first
      sight, her presence had seemed so incongruous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she looks poor!&rdquo; he thought, his heart tightening. And instantly it
      occurred to him that these must be the Fulmer children whom she was living
      with while their parents travelled in Italy. Rumours of Nat Fulmer&rsquo;s
      sudden ascension had reached him, and he had heard that the couple had
      lately been seen in Naples and Palermo. No one had mentioned Susy&rsquo;s name
      in connection with them, and he could hardly tell why he had arrived at
      this conclusion, except perhaps because it seemed natural that, if Susy
      were in trouble, she should turn to her old friend Grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      But why in trouble? What trouble? What could have happened to check her
      triumphant career?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I mean to find out!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      His heart was beating with a tumult of new hopes and old memories. The
      sight of his wife, so remote in mien and manner from the world in which he
      had imagined her to be re-absorbed, changed in a flash his own relation to
      life, and flung a mist of unreality over all that he had been trying to
      think most solid and tangible. Nothing now was substantial to him but the
      stones of the street in which he stood, the front of the house which hid
      her, the bell-handle he already felt in his grasp. He started forward, and
      was halfway to the threshold when a private motor turned the corner, the
      twin glitter of its lamps carpeting the wet street with gold to Susy&rsquo;s
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lansing drew back into the shadow as the motor swept up to the house. A
      man jumped out, and the light fell on Strefford&rsquo;s shambling figure, its
      lazy disjointed movements so unmistakably the same under his fur coat, and
      in the new setting of prosperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lansing stood motionless, staring at the door. Strefford rang, and waited.
      Would Susy appear again? Perhaps she had done so before only because she
      had been on the watch....
    </p>
    <p>
      But no: after a slight delay a bonne appeared&mdash;the breathless
      maid-of-all-work of a busy household&mdash;and at once effaced herself,
      letting the visitor in. Lansing was sure that not a word passed between
      the two, of enquiry on Lord Altringham&rsquo;s part, or of acquiescence on the
      servant&rsquo;s. There could be no doubt that he was expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door closed on him, and a light appeared behind the blind of the
      adjoining window. The maid had shown the visitor into the sitting-room and
      lit the lamp. Upstairs, meanwhile, Susy was no doubt running skilful
      fingers through her tumbled hair and daubing her pale lips with red. Ah,
      how Lansing knew every movement of that familiar rite, even to the pucker
      of the brow and the pouting thrust-out of the lower lip! He was seized
      with a sense of physical sickness as the succession of remembered gestures
      pressed upon his eyes.... And the other man? The other man, inside the
      house, was perhaps at that very instant smiling over the remembrance of
      the same scene!
    </p>
    <p>
      At the thought, Lansing plunged away into the night.
    </p>


<h3>XXVII.</h3>

    <p>
      <span class="smcap">Susy</span> and Lord Altringham sat in the little drawing-room, divided from each
      other by a table carrying a smoky lamp and heaped with tattered
      school-books.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another half hour the bonne, despatched to fetch the children from
      their classes, would be back with her flock; and at any moment Geordie&rsquo;s
      imperious cries might summon his slave up to the nursery. In the scant
      time allotted them, the two sat, and visibly wondered what to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strefford, on entering, had glanced about the dreary room, with its piano
      laden with tattered music, the children&rsquo;s toys littering the lame sofa,
      the bunches of dyed grass and impaled butterflies flanking the cast-bronze
      clock. Then he had turned to Susy and asked simply: &ldquo;Why on earth are you
      here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had not tried to explain; from the first, she had understood the
      impossibility of doing so. And she would not betray her secret longing to
      return to Nick, now that she knew that Nick had taken definite steps for
      his release. In dread lest Strefford should have heard of this, and should
      announce it to her, coupling it with the news of Nick&rsquo;s projected
      marriage, and lest, hearing her fears thus substantiated, she should lose
      her self-control, she had preferred to say, in a voice that she tried to
      make indifferent: &ldquo;The &lsquo;proceedings,&rsquo; or whatever the lawyers call them,
      have begun. While they&rsquo;re going on I like to stay quite by myself.... I
      don&rsquo;t know why....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Strefford, at that, had looked at her keenly. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he murmured; and his
      lips were twisted into their old mocking smile. &ldquo;Speaking of proceedings,&rdquo;
       he went on carelessly, &ldquo;what stage have Ellie&rsquo;s reached, I wonder? I saw
      her and Vanderlyn and Bockheimer all lunching cheerfully together to-day
      at Larue&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The blood rushed to Susy&rsquo;s forehead. She remembered her tragic evening
      with Nelson Vanderlyn, only two months earlier, and thought to herself.
      &ldquo;In time, then, I suppose, Nick and I....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aloud she said: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine how Nelson and Ellie can ever want to see
      each other again. And in a restaurant, of all places!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Strefford continued to smile. &ldquo;My dear, you&rsquo;re incorrigibly old-fashioned.
      Why should two people who&rsquo;ve done each other the best turn they could by
      getting out of each other&rsquo;s way at the right moment behave like sworn
      enemies ever afterward? It&rsquo;s too absurd; the humbug&rsquo;s too flagrant.
      Whatever our generation has failed to do, it&rsquo;s got rid of humbug; and
      that&rsquo;s enough to immortalize it. I daresay Nelson and Ellie never liked
      each other better than they do to-day. Twenty years ago, they&rsquo;d have been
      afraid to confess it; but why shouldn&rsquo;t they now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susy looked at Strefford, conscious that under his words was the ache of
      the disappointment she had caused him; and yet conscious also that that
      very ache was not the overwhelming penetrating emotion he perhaps wished
      it to be, but a pang on a par with a dozen others; and that even while he
      felt it he foresaw the day when he should cease to feel it. And she
      thought to herself that this certainty of oblivion must be bitterer than
      any certainty of pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      A silence had fallen between them. He broke it by rising from his seat,
      and saying with a shrug: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll end by driving me to marry Joan
      Senechal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susy smiled. &ldquo;Well, why not? She&rsquo;s lovely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but she&rsquo;ll bore me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Streff! So should I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps. But nothing like as soon&mdash;&rdquo; He grinned sardonically.
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;d be more margin.&rdquo; He appeared to wait for her to speak. &ldquo;And what
      else on earth are you going to do?&rdquo; he concluded, as she still remained
      silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Streff, I couldn&rsquo;t marry you for a reason like that!&rdquo; she murmured at
      length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then marry me, and find your reason afterward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her lips made a movement of denial, and still in silence she held out her
      hand for good-bye. He clasped it, and then turned away; but on the
      threshold he paused, his screwed-up eyes fixed on her wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      The look moved her, and she added hurriedly: &ldquo;The only reason I can find
      is one for not marrying you. It&rsquo;s because I can&rsquo;t yet feel unmarried
      enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unmarried enough? But I thought Nick was doing his best to make you feel
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But even when he has&mdash;sometimes I think even that won&rsquo;t make
      any difference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He still scrutinized her hesitatingly, with the gravest eyes she had ever
      seen in his careless face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, that&rsquo;s rather the way I feel about you,&rdquo; he said simply as he
      turned to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening after the children had gone to bed Susy sat up late in the
      cheerless sitting-room. She was not thinking of Strefford but of Nick. He
      was coming to Paris&mdash;perhaps he had already arrived. The idea that he
      might be in the same place with her at that very moment, and without her
      knowing it, was so strange and painful that she felt a violent revolt of
      all her strong and joy-loving youth. Why should she go on suffering so
      unbearably, so abjectly, so miserably? If only she could see him, hear his
      voice, even hear him say again such cruel and humiliating words as he had
      spoken on that dreadful day in Venice when that would be better than this
      blankness, this utter and final exclusion from his life! He had been cruel
      to her, unimaginably cruel: hard, arrogant, unjust; and had been so,
      perhaps, deliberately, because he already wanted to be free. But she was
      ready to face even that possibility, to humble herself still farther than
      he had humbled her&mdash;she was ready to do anything, if only she might
      see him once again.
    </p>
    <p>
      She leaned her aching head on her hands and pondered. Do anything? But
      what could she do? Nothing that should hurt him, interfere with his
      liberty, be false to the spirit of their pact: on that she was more than
      ever resolved. She had made a bargain, and she meant to stick to it, not
      for any abstract reason, but simply because she happened to love him in
      that way. Yes&mdash;but to see him again, only once!
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she remembered what Strefford had said about Nelson Vanderlyn and
      his wife. &ldquo;Why should two people who&rsquo;ve just done each other the best turn
      they could behave like sworn enemies ever after?&rdquo; If in offering Nick his
      freedom she had indeed done him such a service as that, perhaps he no
      longer hated her, would no longer be unwilling to see her.... At any rate,
      why should she not write to him on that assumption, write in a spirit of
      simple friendliness, suggesting that they should meet and &ldquo;settle things&rdquo;?
      The business-like word &ldquo;settle&rdquo; (how she hated it) would prove to him that
      she had no secret designs upon his liberty; and besides he was too
      unprejudiced, too modern, too free from what Strefford called humbug, not
      to understand and accept such a suggestion. After all, perhaps Strefford
      was right; it was something to have rid human relations of hypocrisy, even
      if, in the process, so many exquisite things seemed somehow to have been
      torn away with it....
    </p>
    <p>
      She ran up to her room, scribbled a note, and hurried with it through the
      rain and darkness to the post-box at the corner. As she returned through
      the empty street she had an odd feeling that it was not empty&mdash;that
      perhaps Nick was already there, somewhere near her in the night, about to
      follow her to the door, enter the house, go up with her to her bedroom in
      the old way. It was strange how close he had been brought by the mere fact
      of her having written that little note to him!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the bedroom, Geordie lay in his crib in ruddy slumber, and she blew out
      the candle and undressed softly for fear of waking him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nick Lansing, the next day, received Susy&rsquo;s letter, transmitted to his
      hotel from the lawyer&rsquo;s office.
    </p>
    <p>
      He read it carefully, two or three times over, weighing and scrutinizing
      the guarded words. She proposed that they should meet to &ldquo;settle things.&rdquo;
       What things? And why should he accede to such a request? What secret
      purpose had prompted her? It was horrible that nowadays, in thinking of
      Susy, he should always suspect ulterior motives, be meanly on the watch
      for some hidden tortuousness. What on earth was she trying to &ldquo;manage&rdquo;
       now, he wondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few hours ago, at the sight of her, all his hardness had melted, and he
      had charged himself with cruelty, with injustice, with every sin of pride
      against himself and her; but the appearance of Strefford, arriving at that
      late hour, and so evidently expected and welcomed, had driven back the
      rising tide of tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, after all, what was there to wonder at? Nothing was changed in their
      respective situations. He had left his wife, deliberately, and for reasons
      which no subsequent experience had caused him to modify. She had
      apparently acquiesced in his decision, and had utilized it, as she was
      justified in doing, to assure her own future.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all this, what was there to wail or knock the breast between two people
      who prided themselves on looking facts in the face, and making their grim
      best of them, without vain repinings? He had been right in thinking their
      marriage an act of madness. Her charms had overruled his judgment, and
      they had had their year... their mad year... or at least all but two or
      three months of it. But his first intuition had been right; and now they
      must both pay for their madness. The Fates seldom forget the bargains made
      with them, or fail to ask for compound interest. Why not, then, now that
      the time had come, pay up gallantly, and remember of the episode only what
      had made it seem so supremely worth the cost?
    </p>
    <p>
      He sent a pneumatic telegram to Mrs. Nicholas Lansing to say that he would
      call on her that afternoon at four. &ldquo;That ought to give us time,&rdquo; he
      reflected drily, &ldquo;to &lsquo;settle things,&rsquo; as she calls it, without interfering
      with Strefford&rsquo;s afternoon visit.&rdquo;
     </p>


<h3>XXVIII.</h3>

    <p>
      <span class="smcap">Her</span> husband&rsquo;s note had briefly said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-day at four o&rsquo;clock. N.L.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All day she pored over the words in an agony of longing, trying to read
      into them regret, emotion, memories, some echo of the tumult in her own
      bosom. But she had signed &ldquo;Susy,&rdquo; and he signed &ldquo;N.L.&rdquo; That seemed to put
      an abyss between them. After all, she was free and he was not. Perhaps, in
      view of his situation, she had only increased the distance between them by
      her unconventional request for a meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat in the little drawing-room, and the cast-bronze clock ticked out
      the minutes. She would not look out of the window: it might bring bad luck
      to watch for him. And it seemed to her that a thousand invisible spirits,
      hidden demons of good and evil, pressed about her, spying out her
      thoughts, counting her heart-beats, ready to pounce upon the least symptom
      of over-confidence and turn it deftly to derision. Oh, for an altar on
      which to pour out propitiatory offerings! But what sweeter could they have
      than her smothered heart-beats, her choked-back tears?
    </p>
    <p>
      The bell rang, and she stood up as if a spring had jerked her to her feet.
      In the mirror between the dried grasses her face looked long pale
      inanimate. Ah, if he should find her too changed&mdash;! If there were but
      time to dash upstairs and put on a touch of red....
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened; it shut on him; he was there.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said: &ldquo;You wanted to see me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She answered: &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; And her heart seemed to stop beating.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first she could not make out what mysterious change had come over him,
      and why it was that in looking at him she seemed to be looking at a
      stranger; then she perceived that his voice sounded as it used to sound
      when he was talking to other people; and she said to herself, with a sick
      shiver of understanding, that she had become an &ldquo;other person&rdquo; to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a deathly pause; then she faltered out, not knowing what she
      said: &ldquo;Nick&mdash;you&rsquo;ll sit down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said: &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; but did not seem to have heard her, for he continued to
      stand motionless, half the room between them. And slowly the uselessness,
      the hopelessness of his being there overcame her. A wall of granite seemed
      to have built itself up between them. She felt as if it hid her from him,
      as if with those remote new eyes of his he were staring into the wall and
      not at her. Suddenly she said to herself: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s suffering more than I am,
      because he pities me, and is afraid to tell me that he is going to be
      married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The thought stung her pride, and she lifted her head and met his eyes with
      a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s more sensible&mdash;with everything so
      changed in our lives&mdash;that we should meet as friends, in this way? I
      wanted to tell you that you needn&rsquo;t feel&mdash;feel in the least unhappy
      about me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A deep flush rose to his forehead. &ldquo;Oh, I know&mdash;I know that&mdash;&rdquo;
       he declared hastily; and added, with a factitious animation: &ldquo;But thank
      you for telling me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing, is there,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;to make our meeting in this
      way in the least embarrassing or painful to either of us, when both have
      found....&rdquo; She broke off, and held her hand out to him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard about
      you and Coral,&rdquo; she ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      He just touched her hand with cold fingers, and let it drop. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo;
       he said for the third time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t sit down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;that the new way of... of meeting as
      friends... and talking things over without ill-will... is much pleasanter
      and more sensible, after all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s immensely kind of you to feel that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I do feel it!&rdquo; She stopped short, and wondered what on earth she had
      meant to say next, and why she had so abruptly lost the thread of her
      discourse.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the pause she heard him cough slightly and clear his throat. &ldquo;Let me
      say, then,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;m glad too&mdash;immensely glad that your
      own future is so satisfactorily settled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She lifted her glance again to his walled face, in which not a muscle
      stirred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes: it&mdash;it makes everything easier for you, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For you too, I hope.&rdquo; He paused, and then went on: &ldquo;I want also to tell
      you that I perfectly understand&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she interrupted, &ldquo;so do I; your point of view, I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were again silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nick, why can&rsquo;t we be friends real friends? Won&rsquo;t it be easier?&rdquo; she
      broke out at last with twitching lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Easier&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean, about talking things over&mdash;arrangements. There are
      arrangements to be made, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so.&rdquo; He hesitated. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing what I&rsquo;m told&mdash;simply following
      out instructions. The business is easy enough, apparently. I&rsquo;m taking the
      necessary steps&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She reddened a little, and drew a gasping breath. &ldquo;The necessary steps:
      what are they? Everything the lawyers tell one is so confusing.... I don&rsquo;t
      yet understand&mdash;how it&rsquo;s done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My share, you mean? Oh, it&rsquo;s very simple.&rdquo; He paused, and added in a tone
      of laboured ease: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going down to Fontainebleau to-morrow&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stared, not understanding. &ldquo;To Fontainebleau&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her bewilderment drew from him his first frank smile. &ldquo;Well&mdash;I chose
      Fontainebleau&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know why... except that we&rsquo;ve never been there
      together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that she suddenly understood, and the blood rushed to her forehead. She
      stood up without knowing what she was doing, her heart in her throat. &ldquo;How
      grotesque&mdash;how utterly disgusting!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave a slight shrug. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t make the laws....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But isn&rsquo;t it too stupid and degrading that such things should be
      necessary when two people want to part&mdash;?&rdquo; She broke off again,
      silenced by the echo of that fatal &ldquo;want to part.&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to prefer not to dwell farther on the legal obligations
      involved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t yet told me,&rdquo; he suggested, &ldquo;how you happen to be living
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&mdash;with the Fulmer children?&rdquo; She roused herself, trying to catch
      his easier note. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve simply been governessing them for a few weeks,
      while Nat and Grace are in Sicily.&rdquo; She did not say: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve
      parted with Strefford.&rdquo; Somehow it helped her wounded pride a little to
      keep from him the secret of her precarious independence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked his wonder. &ldquo;All alone with that bewildered bonne? But how many
      of them are there? Five? Good Lord!&rdquo; He contemplated the clock with
      unseeing eyes, and then turned them again on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have thought a lot of children would rather get on your nerves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not these children. They&rsquo;re so good to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well, I suppose it won&rsquo;t be for long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sent his eyes again about the room, which his absent-minded gaze seemed
      to reduce to its dismal constituent elements, and added, with an obvious
      effort at small talk: &ldquo;I hear the Fulmers are not hitting it off very well
      since his success. Is it true that he&rsquo;s going to marry Violet Melrose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The blood rose to Susy&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Oh, never, never! He and Grace are
      travelling together now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t know. People say things....&rdquo; He was visibly embarrassed with
      the subject, and sorry that he had broached it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of the things that people say are true. But Grace doesn&rsquo;t mind. She
      says she and Nat belong to each other. They can&rsquo;t help it, she thinks,
      after having been through such a lot together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear old Grace!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had risen from his chair, and this time she made no effort to detain
      him. He seemed to have recovered his self-composure, and it struck her
      painfully, humiliatingly almost, that he should have spoken in that light
      way of the expedition to Fontainebleau on the morrow.... Well, men were
      different, she supposed; she remembered having felt that once before about
      Nick.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on the tip of her tongue to cry out: &ldquo;But wait&mdash;wait! I&rsquo;m not
      going to marry Strefford after all!&rdquo;&mdash;but to do so would seem like an
      appeal to his compassion, to his indulgence; and that was not what she
      wanted. She could never forget that he had left her because he had not
      been able to forgive her for &ldquo;managing&rdquo;&mdash;and not for the world would
      she have him think that this meeting had been planned for such a purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he doesn&rsquo;t see that I am different, in spite of appearances... and
      that I never was what he said I was that day&mdash;if in all these months
      it hasn&rsquo;t come over him, what&rsquo;s the use of trying to make him see it now?&rdquo;
       she mused. And then, her thoughts hurrying on: &ldquo;Perhaps he&rsquo;s suffering too&mdash;I
      believe he is suffering&mdash;at any rate, he&rsquo;s suffering for me, if not for
      himself. But if he&rsquo;s pledged to Coral, what can he do? What would he think
      of me if I tried to make him break his word to her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There he stood&mdash;the man who was &ldquo;going to Fontainebleau to-morrow&rdquo;;
      who called it &ldquo;taking the necessary steps!&rdquo; Who could smile as he made the
      careless statement! A world seemed to divide them already: it was as if
      their parting were already over. All the words, cries, arguments beating
      loud wings in her dropped back into silence. The only thought left was:
      &ldquo;How much longer does he mean to go on standing there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He may have read the question in her face, for turning back from an
      absorbed contemplation of the window curtains he said: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing
      else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean: you spoke of things to be settled&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She flushed, suddenly remembering the pretext she had used to summon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she faltered, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know... I thought there might be.... But the
      lawyers, I suppose....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She saw the relief on his contracted face. &ldquo;Exactly. I&rsquo;ve always thought
      it was best to leave it to them. I assure you&rdquo;&mdash;again for a moment
      the smile strained his lips&mdash;&ldquo;I shall do nothing to interfere with a
      quick settlement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stood motionless, feeling herself turn to stone. He appeared already a
      long way off, like a figure vanishing down a remote perspective.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&mdash;good-bye,&rdquo; she heard him say from its farther end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&mdash;good-bye,&rdquo; she faltered, as if she had not had the word ready,
      and was relieved to have him supply it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped again on the threshold, looked back at her, began to speak.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve&mdash;&rdquo; he said; then he repeated &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; as though to make sure
      he had not forgotten to say it; and the door closed on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was over; she had had her last chance and missed it. Now, whatever
      happened, the one thing she had lived and longed for would never be. He
      had come, and she had let him go again....
    </p>
    <p>
      How had it come about? Would she ever be able to explain it to herself?
      How was it that she, so fertile in strategy, so practiced in feminine
      arts, had stood there before him, helpless, inarticulate, like a
      school-girl a-choke with her first love-longing? If he was gone, and gone
      never to return, it was her own fault, and none but hers. What had she
      done to move him, detain him, make his heart beat and his head swim as
      hers were beating and swimming? She stood aghast at her own inadequacy,
      her stony inexpressiveness....
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly she lifted her hands to her throbbing forehead and cried out:
      &ldquo;But this is love! This must be love!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had loved him before, she supposed; for what else was she to call the
      impulse that had drawn her to him, taught her how to overcome his
      scruples, and whirled him away with her on their mad adventure? Well, if
      that was love, this was something so much larger and deeper that the other
      feeling seemed the mere dancing of her blood in tune with his....
    </p>
    <p>
      But, no! Real love, great love, the love that poets sang, and privileged
      and tortured beings lived and died of, that love had its own superior
      expressiveness, and the sure command of its means. The petty arts of
      coquetry were no farther from it than the numbness of the untaught girl.
      Great love was wise, strong, powerful, like genius, like any other
      dominant form of human power. It knew itself, and what it wanted, and how
      to attain its ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not great love, then... but just the common humble average of human love
      was hers. And it had come to her so newly, so overwhelmingly, with a face
      so grave, a touch so startling, that she had stood there petrified,
      humbled at the first look of its eyes, recognizing that what she had once
      taken for love was merely pleasure and spring-time, and the flavour of
      youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how was I to know? And now it&rsquo;s too late!&rdquo; she wailed.
    </p>


<h3>XXIX.</h3>

    <p>
      <span class="smcap">The</span> inhabitants of the little house in Passy were of necessity early
      risers; but when Susy jumped out of bed the next morning no one else was
      astir, and it lacked nearly an hour of the call of the bonne&rsquo;s
      alarm-clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Susy leaned out of her dark room into the darker night. A
      cold drizzle fell on her face, and she shivered and drew back. Then,
      lighting a candle, and shading it, as her habit was, from the sleeping
      child, she slipped on her dressing-gown and opened the door. On the
      threshold she paused to look at her watch. Only half-past five! She
      thought with compunction of the unkindness of breaking in on Junie
      Fulmer&rsquo;s slumbers; but such scruples did not weigh an ounce in the balance
      of her purpose. Poor Junie would have to oversleep herself on Sunday, that
      was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Susy stole into the passage, opened a door, and cast her light on the
      girl&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Junie! Dearest Junie, you must wake up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Junie lay in the abandonment of youthful sleep; but at the sound of her
      name she sat up with the promptness of a grown person on whom domestic
      burdens have long weighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which one of them is it?&rdquo; she asked, one foot already out of bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Junie dear, no... it&rsquo;s nothing wrong with the children... or with
      anybody,&rdquo; Susy stammered, on her knees by the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the candlelight, she saw Junie&rsquo;s anxious brow darken reproachfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Susy, then why&mdash;? I was just dreaming we were all driving about
      Rome in a great big motor-car with father and mother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry, dear. What a lovely dream! I&rsquo;m a brute to have interrupted
      it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She felt the little girl&rsquo;s awakening scrutiny. &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s nothing wrong
      with anybody, why are you crying, Susy? Is it you there&rsquo;s something wrong
      with? What has happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I crying?&rdquo; Susy rose from her knees and sat down on the counterpane.
      &ldquo;Yes, it is me. And I had to disturb you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Susy, darling, what is it?&rdquo; Junie&rsquo;s arms were about her in a flash,
      and Susy grasped them in burning fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Junie, listen! I&rsquo;ve got to go away at once&mdash;to leave you all for the
      whole day. I may not be back till late this evening; late to-night; I
      can&rsquo;t tell. I promised your mother I&rsquo;d never leave you; but I&rsquo;ve got to&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
      got to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Junie considered her agitated face with fully awakened eyes. &ldquo;Oh, I won&rsquo;t
      tell, you know, you old brick,&rdquo; she said with simplicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Susy hugged her. &ldquo;Junie, Junie, you darling! But that wasn&rsquo;t what I meant.
      Of course you may tell&mdash;you must tell. I shall write to your mother
      myself. But what worries me is the idea of having to go away&mdash;away
      from Paris&mdash;for the whole day, with Geordie still coughing a little,
      and no one but that silly Angele to stay with him while you&rsquo;re out&mdash;and
      no one but you to take yourself and the others to school. But Junie,
      Junie, I&rsquo;ve got to do it!&rdquo; she sobbed out, clutching the child tighter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Junie Fulmer, with her strangely mature perception of the case, and
      seemingly of every case that fate might call on her to deal with, sat for
      a moment motionless in Susy&rsquo;s hold. Then she freed her wrists with an
      adroit twist, and leaning back against the pillows said judiciously:
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never in the world bring up a family of your own if you take on
      like this over other people&rsquo;s children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Through all her turmoil of spirit the observation drew a laugh from Susy.
      &ldquo;Oh, a family of my own&mdash;I don&rsquo;t deserve one, the way I&rsquo;m behaving to
      your&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Junie still considered her. &ldquo;My dear, a change will do you good: you need
      it,&rdquo; she pronounced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Susy rose with a laughing sigh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not at all sure it will! But I&rsquo;ve got
      to have it, all the same. Only I do feel anxious&mdash;and I can&rsquo;t even
      leave you my address!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Junie still seemed to examine the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you even tell me where you&rsquo;re going?&rdquo; she ventured, as if not quite
      sure of the delicacy of asking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;no, I don&rsquo;t think I can; not till I get back. Besides, even if
      I could it wouldn&rsquo;t be much use, because I couldn&rsquo;t give you my address
      there. I don&rsquo;t know what it will be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what does it matter, if you&rsquo;re coming back to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;m coming back! How could you possibly imagine I should think
      of leaving you for more than a day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid&mdash;not much, that is, with the poker, and
      Nat&rsquo;s water-pistol,&rdquo; emended Junie, still judicious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Susy again enfolded her vehemently, and then turned to more practical
      matters. She explained that she wished if possible to catch an
      eight-thirty train from the Gare de Lyon, and that there was not a moment
      to lose if the children were to be dressed and fed, and full instructions
      written out for Junie and Angele, before she rushed for the underground.
    </p>
    <p>
      While she bathed Geordie, and then hurried into her own clothes, she could
      not help wondering at her own extreme solicitude for her charges. She
      remembered, with a pang, how often she had deserted Clarissa Vanderlyn for
      the whole day, and even for two or three in succession&mdash;poor little
      Clarissa, whom she knew to be so unprotected, so exposed to evil
      influences. She had been too much absorbed in her own greedy bliss to be
      more than intermittently aware of the child; but now, she felt, no sorrow
      however ravaging, no happiness however absorbing, would ever again isolate
      her from her kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then these children were so different! The exquisite Clarissa was
      already the predestined victim of her surroundings: her budding soul was
      divided from Susy&rsquo;s by the same barrier of incomprehension that separated
      the latter from Mrs. Vanderlyn. Clarissa had nothing to teach Susy but the
      horror of her own hard little appetites; whereas the company of the noisy
      argumentative Fulmers had been a school of wisdom and abnegation.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she applied the brush to Geordie&rsquo;s shining head and the handkerchief to
      his snuffling nose, the sense of what she owed him was so borne in on Susy
      that she interrupted the process to catch him to her bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have such a story to tell you when I get back to-night, if you&rsquo;ll
      promise me to be good all day,&rdquo; she bargained with him; and Geordie,
      always astute, bargained back: &ldquo;Before I promise, I&rsquo;d like to know what
      story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At length all was in order. Junie had been enlightened, and Angele
      stunned, by the minuteness of Susy&rsquo;s instructions; and the latter,
      waterproofed and stoutly shod, descended the doorstep, and paused to wave
      at the pyramid of heads yearning to her from an upper window.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was hardly light, and still raining, when she turned into the dismal
      street. As usual, it was empty; but at the corner she perceived a
      hesitating taxi, with luggage piled beside the driver. Perhaps it was some
      early traveller, just arriving, who would release the carriage in time for
      her to catch it, and thus avoid the walk to the metro, and the subsequent
      strap-hanging; for it was the work-people&rsquo;s hour. Susy raced toward the
      vehicle, which, overcoming its hesitation, was beginning to move in her
      direction. Observing this, she stopped to see where it would discharge its
      load. Thereupon the taxi stopped also, and the load discharged itself in
      front of her in the shape of Nick Lansing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two stood staring at each other through the rain till Nick broke out:
      &ldquo;Where are you going? I came to get you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To get me? To get me?&rdquo; she repeated. Beside the driver she had suddenly
      remarked the old suit-case from which her husband had obliged her to
      extract Strefford&rsquo;s cigars as they were leaving Como; and everything that
      had happened since seemed to fall away and vanish in the pang and rapture
      of that memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To get you; yes. Of course.&rdquo; He spoke the words peremptorily, almost as
      if they were an order. &ldquo;Where were you going?&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without answering, she turned toward the house. He followed her, and the
      laden taxi closed the procession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are you out in such weather without an umbrella?&rdquo; he continued, in
      the same severe tone, drawing her under the shelter of his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, because Junie&rsquo;s umbrella is in tatters, and I had to leave her mine,
      as I was going away for the whole day.&rdquo; She spoke the words like a person
      in a trance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the whole day? At this hour? Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were on the doorstep, and she fumbled automatically for her key, let
      herself in, and led the way to the sitting-room. It had not been tidied up
      since the night before. The children&rsquo;s school books lay scattered on the
      table and sofa, and the empty fireplace was grey with ashes. She turned to
      Nick in the pallid light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was going to see you,&rdquo; she stammered, &ldquo;I was going to follow you to
      Fontainebleau, if necessary, to tell you... to prevent you....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He repeated in the same aggressive tone: &ldquo;Tell me what? Prevent what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell you that there must be some other way... some decent way... of our
      separating... without that horror, that horror of your going off with a
      woman....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stared, and then burst into a laugh. The blood rushed to her face. She
      had caught a familiar ring in his laugh, and it wounded her. What business
      had he, at such a time, to laugh in the old way?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry; but there is no other way, I&rsquo;m afraid. No other way but one,&rdquo;
       he corrected himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised her head sharply. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you should be the woman.&mdash;Oh, my dear!&rdquo; He had dropped his
      mocking smile, and was at her side, her hands in his. &ldquo;Oh, my dear, don&rsquo;t
      you see that we&rsquo;ve both been feeling the same thing, and at the same hour?
      You lay awake thinking of it all night, didn&rsquo;t you? So did I. Whenever the
      clock struck, I said to myself: &lsquo;She&rsquo;s hearing it too.&rsquo; And I was up
      before daylight, and packed my traps&mdash;for I never want to set foot
      again in that awful hotel where I&rsquo;ve lived in hell for the last three
      days. And I swore to myself that I&rsquo;d go off with a woman by the first
      train I could catch&mdash;and so I mean to, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stood before him numb. Yes, numb: that was the worst of it! The
      violence of the reaction had been too great, and she could hardly
      understand what he was saying. Instead, she noticed that the tassel of the
      window-blind was torn off again (oh, those children!), and vaguely
      wondered if his luggage were safe on the waiting taxi. One heard such
      stories....
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice came back to her. &ldquo;Susy! Listen!&rdquo; he was entreating. &ldquo;You must
      see yourself that it can&rsquo;t be. We&rsquo;re married&mdash;isn&rsquo;t that all that
      matters? Oh, I know&mdash;I&rsquo;ve behaved like a brute: a cursed arrogant
      ass! You couldn&rsquo;t wish that ass a worse kicking than I&rsquo;ve given him! But
      that&rsquo;s not the point, you see. The point is that we&rsquo;re married....
      Married.... Doesn&rsquo;t it mean something to you, something&mdash;inexorable?
      It does to me. I didn&rsquo;t dream it would&mdash;in just that way. But all I
      can say is that I suppose the people who don&rsquo;t feel it aren&rsquo;t really
      married&mdash;and they&rsquo;d better separate; much better. As for us&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Through her tears she gasped out: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I felt... that&rsquo;s what I
      said to Streff....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was upon her with a great embrace. &ldquo;My darling! My darling! You have
      told him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she panted. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m living here.&rdquo; She paused. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve
      told Coral?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She felt his embrace relax. He drew away a little, still holding her, but
      with lowered head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No... I... haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Nick! But then&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He caught her to him again, resentfully. &ldquo;Well&mdash;then what? What do
      you mean? What earthly difference does it make?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you&rsquo;ve told her you were going to marry her&mdash;&rdquo; (Try as she
      would, her voice was full of silver chimes.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marry her? Marry her?&rdquo; he echoed. &ldquo;But how could I? What does marriage
      mean anyhow? If it means anything at all it means&mdash;you! And I can&rsquo;t
      ask Coral Hicks just to come and live with me, can I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Between crying and laughing she lay on his breast, and his hand passed
      over her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were silent for a while; then he began again: &ldquo;You said it yourself
      yesterday, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She strayed back from sunlit distances. &ldquo;Yesterday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes: that Grace Fulmer says you can&rsquo;t separate two people who&rsquo;ve been
      through a lot of things&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, been through them together&mdash;it&rsquo;s not the things, you see, it&rsquo;s
      the togetherness,&rdquo; she interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The togetherness&mdash;that&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; He seized on the word as if it had
      just been coined to express their case, and his mind could rest in it
      without farther labour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door-bell rang, and they started. Through the window they saw the
      taxi-driver gesticulating enquiries as to the fate of the luggage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wants to know if he&rsquo;s to leave it here,&rdquo; Susy laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;no! You&rsquo;re to come with me,&rdquo; her husband declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come with you?&rdquo; She laughed again at the absurdity of the suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course: this very instant. What did you suppose? That I was going away
      without you? Run up and pack your things,&rdquo; he commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My things? My things? But I can&rsquo;t leave the children!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stared, between indignation and amusement. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t leave the children?
      Nonsense! Why, you said yourself you were going to follow me to
      Fontainebleau&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She reddened again, this time a little painfully &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know what I was
      doing.... I had to find you... but I should have come back this evening,
      no matter what happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded, and met his gaze resolutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but really&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, I can&rsquo;t leave the children till Nat and Grace come back. I
      promised I wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but you didn&rsquo;t know then.... Why on earth can&rsquo;t their nurse look
      after them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t any nurse but me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s only for two weeks more,&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;Two weeks! Do you know
      how long I&rsquo;ve been without you!&rdquo; He seized her by both wrists, and drew
      them against his breast. &ldquo;Come with me at least for two days&mdash;Susy!&rdquo;
       he entreated her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the very first time you&rsquo;ve said my name!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Susy, Susy, then&mdash;my Susy&mdash;Susy! And you&rsquo;ve only said mine
      once, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nick!&rdquo; she sighed, at peace, as if the one syllable were a magic seed
      that hung out great branches to envelop them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, Susy, be reasonable. Come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reasonable&mdash;oh, reasonable!&rdquo; she sobbed through laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unreasonable, then! That&rsquo;s even better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She freed herself, and drew back gently. &ldquo;Nick, I swore I wouldn&rsquo;t leave
      them; and I can&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s not only my promise to their mother&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      what they&rsquo;ve been to me themselves. You don&rsquo;t, know... You can&rsquo;t imagine
      the things they&rsquo;ve taught me. They&rsquo;re awfully naughty at times, because
      they&rsquo;re so clever; but when they&rsquo;re good they&rsquo;re the wisest people I
      know.&rdquo; She paused, and a sudden inspiration illuminated her. &ldquo;But why
      shouldn&rsquo;t we take them with us?&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband&rsquo;s arms fell away from her, and he stood dumfounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take them with us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All five of them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t possibly separate them. And Junie and Nat will
      help us to look after the young ones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help us!&rdquo; he groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll see; they won&rsquo;t bother you. Just leave it to me; I&rsquo;ll manage&mdash;&rdquo;
       The word stopped her short, and an agony of crimson suffused her from brow
      to throat. Their eyes met; and without a word he stooped and laid his lips
      gently on the stain of red on her neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nick,&rdquo; she breathed, her hands in his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But those children&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Instead of answering, she questioned: &ldquo;Where are we going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face lit up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anywhere, dearest, that you choose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;I choose Fontainebleau!&rdquo; she exulted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I! But we can&rsquo;t take all those children to an hotel at
      Fontainebleau, can we?&rdquo; he questioned weakly. &ldquo;You see, dear, there&rsquo;s the
      mere expense of it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes were already travelling far ahead of him. &ldquo;The expense won&rsquo;t
      amount to much. I&rsquo;ve just remembered that Angele, the bonne, has a sister
      who is cook there in a nice old-fashioned pension which must be almost
      empty at this time of year. I&rsquo;m sure I can ma&mdash;arrange easily,&rdquo; she
      hurried on, nearly tripping again over the fatal word. &ldquo;And just think of
      the treat it will be to them! This is Friday, and I can get them let off
      from their afternoon classes, and keep them in the country till Monday.
      Poor darlings, they haven&rsquo;t been out of Paris for months! And I daresay
      the change will cure Geordie&rsquo;s cough&mdash;Geordie&rsquo;s the youngest,&rdquo; she
      explained, surprised to find herself, even in the rapture of reunion, so
      absorbed in the welfare of the Fulmers.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was conscious that her husband was surprised also; but instead of
      prolonging the argument he simply questioned: &ldquo;Was Geordie the chap you
      had in your arms when you opened the front door the night before last?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She echoed: &ldquo;I opened the front door the night before last?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To a boy with a parcel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she sobbed, &ldquo;you were there? You were watching?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held her to him, and the currents flowed between them warm and full as
      on the night of their moon over Como.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a trice, after that, she had the matter in hand and her forces
      marshalled. The taxi was paid, Nick&rsquo;s luggage deposited in the vestibule,
      and the children, just piling down to breakfast, were summoned in to hear
      the news.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was apparent that, seasoned to surprises as they were, Nick&rsquo;s presence
      took them aback. But when, between laughter and embraces, his identity,
      and his right to be where he was, had been made clear to them, Junie
      dismissed the matter by asking him in her practical way: &ldquo;Then I suppose
      we may talk about you to Susy now?&rdquo;&mdash;and thereafter all five
      addressed themselves to the vision of their imminent holiday.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that moment the little house became the centre of a whirlwind. Treats
      so unforeseen, and of such magnitude, were rare in the young Fulmers&rsquo;
      experience, and had it not been for Junie&rsquo;s steadying influence Susy&rsquo;s
      charges would have got out of hand. But young Nat, appealed to by Nick on
      the ground of their common manhood, was induced to forego celebrating the
      event on his motor horn (the very same which had tortured the New
      Hampshire echoes), and to assert his authority over his juniors; and
      finally a plan began to emerge from the chaos, and each child to fit into
      it like a bit of a picture puzzle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Susy, riding the whirlwind with her usual firmness, nevertheless felt an
      undercurrent of anxiety. There had been no time as yet, between her and
      Nick, to revert to money matters; and where there was so little money it
      could not, obviously, much matter. But that was the more reason for being
      secretly aghast at her intrepid resolve not to separate herself from her
      charges. A three days&rsquo; honey-moon with five children in the party&mdash;and
      children with the Fulmer appetite&mdash;could not but be a costly
      business; and while she settled details, packed them off to school, and
      routed out such nondescript receptacles as the house contained in the way
      of luggage, her thoughts remained fixed on the familiar financial problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes&mdash;it was cruel to have it rear its hated head, even through the
      bursting boughs of her new spring; but there it was, the perpetual serpent
      in her Eden, to be bribed, fed, sent to sleep with such scraps as she
      could beg, borrow or steal for it. And she supposed it was the price that
      fate meant her to pay for her blessedness, and was surer than ever that
      the blessedness was worth it. Only, how was she to compound the business
      with her new principles?
    </p>
    <p>
      With the children&rsquo;s things to pack, luncheon to be got ready, and the
      Fontainebleau pension to be telephoned to, there was little time to waste
      on moral casuistry; and Susy asked herself with a certain irony if the
      chronic lack of time to deal with money difficulties had not been the
      chief cause of her previous lapses. There was no time to deal with this
      question either; no time, in short, to do anything but rush forward on a
      great gale of plans and preparations, in the course of which she whirled
      Nick forth to buy some charcuterie for luncheon, and telephone to
      Fontainebleau.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once he was gone&mdash;and after watching him safely round the corner&mdash;she
      too got into her wraps, and transferring a small packet from her
      dressing-case to her pocket, hastened out in a different direction.
    </p>


<h3>XXX.</h3>

    <p>
      <span class="smcap">It</span> took two brimming taxi-cabs to carry the Nicholas Lansings to the
      station on their second honey-moon. In the first were Nick, Susy and the
      luggage of the whole party (little Nat&rsquo;s motor horn included, as a last
      concession, and because he had hitherto forborne to play on it); and in
      the second, the five Fulmers, the bonne, who at the eleventh hour had
      refused to be left, a cage-full of canaries, and a foundling kitten who
      had murderous designs on them; all of which had to be taken because, if
      the bonne came, there would be nobody left to look after them.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the corner Susy tore herself from Nick&rsquo;s arms and held up the
      procession while she ran back to the second taxi to make sure that the
      bonne had brought the house-key. It was found of course that she hadn&rsquo;t
      but that Junie had; whereupon the caravan got under way again, and reached
      the station just as the train was starting; and there, by some miracle of
      good nature on the part of the guard, they were all packed together into
      an empty compartment&mdash;no doubt, as Susy remarked, because train
      officials never failed to spot a newly-married couple, and treat them
      kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The children, sentinelled by Junie, at first gave promise of superhuman
      goodness; but presently their feelings overflowed, and they were not to be
      quieted till it had been agreed that Nat should blow his motor-horn at
      each halt, while the twins called out the names of the stations, and
      Geordie, with the canaries and kitten, affected to change trains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luckily the halts were few; but the excitement of travel, combined with
      over-indulgence in the chocolates imprudently provided by Nick,
      overwhelmed Geordie with a sudden melancholy that could be appeased only
      by Susy&rsquo;s telling him stories till they arrived at Fontainebleau.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was soft, with mild gleams of sunlight on decaying foliage; and
      after luggage and livestock had been dropped at the pension Susy confessed
      that she had promised the children a scamper in the forest, and buns in a
      tea-shop afterward. Nick placidly agreed, and darkness had long fallen,
      and a great many buns been consumed, when at length the procession turned
      down the street toward the pension, headed by Nick with the sleeping
      Geordie on his shoulder, while the others, speechless with fatigue and
      food, hung heavily on Susy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been decided that, as the bonne was of the party, the children
      might be entrusted to her for the night, and Nick and Susy establish
      themselves in an adjacent hotel. Nick had flattered himself that they
      might remove their possessions there when they returned from the tea-room;
      but Susy, manifestly surprised at the idea, reminded him that her charges
      must first be given their supper and put to bed. She suggested that he
      should meanwhile take the bags to the hotel, and promised to join him as
      soon as Geordie was asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a long time coming, but waiting for her was sweet, even in a
      deserted hotel reading-room insufficiently heated by a sulky stove; and
      after he had glanced through his morning&rsquo;s mail, hurriedly thrust into his
      pocket as he left Paris, he sank into a state of drowsy beatitude. It was
      all the maddest business in the world, yet it did not give him the sense
      of unreality that had made their first adventure a mere golden dream; and
      he sat and waited with the security of one in whom dear habits have struck
      deep roots. In this mood of acquiescence even the presence of the five
      Fulmers seemed a natural and necessary consequence of all the rest; and
      when Susy at length appeared, a little pale and tired, with the brooding
      inward look that busy mothers bring from the nursery, that too seemed
      natural and necessary, and part of the new order of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had wandered out to a cheap restaurant for dinner; now, in the damp
      December night, they were walking back to the hotel under a sky full of
      rain-clouds. They seemed to have said everything to each other, and yet
      barely to have begun what they had to tell; and at each step they took,
      their heavy feet dragged a great load of bliss.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the hotel almost all the lights were already out; and they groped their
      way to the third floor room which was the only one that Susy had found
      cheap enough. A ray from a street-lamp struck up through the unshuttered
      windows; and after Nick had revived the fire they drew their chairs close
      to it, and sat quietly for a while in the dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their silence was so sweet that Nick could not make up his mind to break
      it; not to do so gave his tossing spirit such a sense of permanence, of
      having at last unlimited time before him in which to taste his joy and let
      its sweetness stream through him. But at length he roused himself to say:
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s queer how things coincide. I&rsquo;ve had a little bit of good news in one
      of the letters I got this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susy took the announcement serenely. &ldquo;Well, you would, you know,&rdquo; she
      commented, as if the day had been too obviously designed for bliss to
      escape the notice of its dispensers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he continued with a thrill of pardonable pride. &ldquo;During the cruise
      I did a couple of articles on Crete&mdash;oh, just travel-impressions, of
      course; they couldn&rsquo;t be more. But the editor of the New Review has
      accepted them, and asks for others. And here&rsquo;s his cheque, if you please!
      So you see you might have let me take the jolly room downstairs with the
      pink curtains. And it makes me awfully hopeful about my book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had expected a rapturous outburst, and perhaps some reassertion of
      wifely faith in the glorious future that awaited The Pageant of Alexander;
      and deep down under the lover&rsquo;s well-being the author felt a faint twinge
      of mortified vanity when Susy, leaping to her feet, cried out, ravenously
      and without preamble: &ldquo;Oh, Nick, Nick&mdash;let me see how much they&rsquo;ve
      given you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He flourished the cheque before her in the firelight. &ldquo;A couple of
      hundred, you mercenary wretch!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, oh&mdash;&rdquo; she gasped, as if the good news had been almost too much
      for her tense nerves; and then surprised him by dropping to the ground,
      and burying her face against his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Susy, my Susy,&rdquo; he whispered, his hand on her shaking shoulder. &ldquo;Why,
      dear, what is it? You&rsquo;re not crying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Nick, Nick&mdash;two hundred? Two hundred dollars? Then I&rsquo;ve got to
      tell you&mdash;oh now, at once!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A faint chill ran over him, and involuntarily his hand drew back from her
      bowed figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now? Oh, why now?&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;What on earth does it matter now&mdash;whatever
      it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it does matter&mdash;it matters more than you can think!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She straightened herself, still kneeling before him, and lifted her head
      so that the firelight behind her turned her hair into a ruddy halo. &ldquo;Oh,
      Nick, the bracelet&mdash;Ellie&rsquo;s bracelet.... I&rsquo;ve never returned it to
      her,&rdquo; she faltered out.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt himself recoiling under the hands with which she clutched his
      knees. For an instant he did not remember what she alluded to; it was the
      mere mention of Ellie Vanderlyn&rsquo;s name that had fallen between them like
      an icy shadow. What an incorrigible fool he had been to think they could
      ever shake off such memories, or cease to be the slaves of such a past!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bracelet?&mdash;Oh, yes,&rdquo; he said, suddenly understanding, and
      feeling the chill mount slowly to his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the bracelet... Oh, Nick, I meant to give it back at once; I did&mdash;I
      did; but the day you went away I forgot everything else. And when I found
      the thing, in the bottom of my bag, weeks afterward, I thought everything
      was over between you and me, and I had begun to see Ellie again, and she
      was kind to me and how could I?&rdquo; To save his life he could have found no
      answer, and she pressed on: &ldquo;And so this morning, when I saw you were
      frightened by the expense of bringing all the children with us, and when I
      felt I couldn&rsquo;t leave them, and couldn&rsquo;t leave you either, I remembered
      the bracelet; and I sent you off to telephone while I rushed round the
      corner to a little jeweller&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;d been before, and pawned it so that
      you shouldn&rsquo;t have to pay for the children.... But now, darling, you see,
      if you&rsquo;ve got all that money, I can get it out of pawn at once, can&rsquo;t I,
      and send it back to her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She flung her arms about him, and he held her fast, wondering if the tears
      he felt were hers or his. Still he did not speak; but as he clasped her
      close she added, with an irrepressible flash of her old irony: &ldquo;Not that
      Ellie will understand why I&rsquo;ve done it. She&rsquo;s never yet been able to make
      out why you returned her scarf-pin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a long time she continued to lean against him, her head on his knees,
      as she had done on the terrace of Como on the last night of their
      honeymoon. She had ceased to talk, and he sat silent also, passing his
      hand quietly to and fro over her hair. The first rapture had been
      succeeded by soberer feelings. Her confession had broken up the frozen
      pride about his heart, and humbled him to the earth; but it had also
      roused forgotten things, memories and scruples swept aside in the first
      rush of their reunion. He and she belonged to each other for always: he
      understood that now. The impulse which had first drawn them together
      again, in spite of reason, in spite of themselves almost, that deep-seated
      instinctive need that each had of the other, would never again wholly let
      them go. Yet as he sat there he thought of Strefford, he thought of Coral
      Hicks. He had been a coward in regard to Coral, and Susy had been sincere
      and courageous in regard to Strefford. Yet his mind dwelt on Coral with
      tenderness, with compunction, with remorse; and he was almost sure that
      Susy had already put Strefford utterly out of her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the old contrast between the two ways of loving, the man&rsquo;s way and
      the woman&rsquo;s; and after a moment it seemed to Nick natural enough that
      Susy, from the very moment of finding him again, should feel neither pity
      nor regret, and that Strefford should already be to her as if he had never
      been. After all, there was something Providential in such arrangements.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stooped closer, pressed her dreaming head between his hands, and
      whispered: &ldquo;Wake up; it&rsquo;s bedtime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose; but as she moved away to turn on the light he caught her hand
      and drew her to the window. They leaned on the sill in the darkness, and
      through the clouds, from which a few drops were already falling, the moon,
      labouring upward, swam into a space of sky, cast her troubled glory on
      them, and was again hidden.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
